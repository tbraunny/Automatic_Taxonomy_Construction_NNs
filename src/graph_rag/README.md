# GraphRAG 3/18/2025

GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances language model performance by combining graph-based knowledge representation with retrieval-augmented generation. It is ideal for tasks requiring external knowledge integration, such as answering complex questions, summarizing information, or generating factually accurate responses.

## Description

GraphRAG serves as a knowledge base for a language model (LLM) to infer relationships within an ontology or to derive a schema for a taxonomy.

## Getting Started

The README is structured as follows:
1. Python script (`.py`) instructions first
2. Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) instructions follow

### Dependencies

- **Core Dependencies**:
  - `langchain`
  - `neo4j`
  - `ollama`

- **Additional Dependencies** (for running `FinalGraphRAG.ipynb`):
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - `yfiles_jupyter_graphs` for graph visualization

### Installing
This guide is for installation on linux

- **langchain**: [Installation Guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)
```bash
pip install langchain-core langchain-neo4j langchain-community langchain-experimental langchain-ollama neo4j
```

- **neo4j**: [Installation Guide](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/) 

```bash
wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.com/neotechnology.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/neotechnology.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/neotechnology.gpg] https://debian.neo4j.com stable latest' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash, specify your version
sudo apt-get install neo4j=1:2025.02.0
```

*Note: The APOC and Neosemantics plugins are required.*
  
Since APOC and Neosemantics relies on Neo4jâ€™s internal APIs you need to use the matching APOC version for your Neo4j installation. Make sure that the first two version numbers match between Neo4j and APOC.

[Apoc plugin download](https://github.com/neo4j/apoc/releases/)

[Neosemantics plugin download](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neosemantics/releases)

these will both be .jar files and will need to be placed in this directiory: /var/lib/neo4j/plugins/

You will then need to add configuration for them by adding the following lines to /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf at the bottom of the file

```/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
dbms.security.auth_minimum_password_length=1 (allows the default password to be neo4j)
server.unmanaged_extension_classes=n10s.endpoint=/rdf
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=apoc.*, n10s.*
dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=apoc.*, n10s.*, apoc.load.*,apoc.coll.*
dbms.directories.import=Automatic_Taxonomy_Construction_NNs/data
```
*Note: ensure paths all paths are correct according to your local machine.*

to start the server, restart, and get the status of the server or start a cyphershell:

```bash
sudo systemctl start neo4j
sudo systemctl status neo4j
sudo systemctl restart neo4j
sudo cypher-shell
```

to import rdf/xml data use the following Cypher queries in cypher-shell:
```Cypher
MATCH(n) DETACH DELETE n;

DROP CONSTRAINT n10s_unique_uri;

CREATE CONSTRAINT n10s_unique_uri FOR (r:Resource) REQUIRE r.uri IS UNIQUE;

CALL n10s.graphconfig.init({
    handleVocabUris: "SHORTEN",
    keepLangTag: false,
    handleMultival: "ARRAY"
});

CALL n10s.rdf.import.fetch("file:///Automatic_Taxonomy_Construction_NNs/data/Annett-o/annett-o-0.1.owl", "RDF/XML");
```
*Note: ensure paths all paths are correct according to your local machine.*

- **ollama**: [PyPI Page](https://pypi.org/project/ollama/)  
  *Currently uses the model `llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16`, but can be changed in the source code.*

- **Jupyter Notebook**:  
  Requires `yfiles_jupyter_graphs` for visualization  
  [yFiles Jupyter Graphs GitHub](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-jupyter-graphs)
   ```bash
  pip install yfiles_jupyter_graphs
  ```


### Program Details

- **graphRAG.py**  
A script that prints answers to user questions based on predefined template prompts. Modifications to the question or model must be made in the source code.
cd into Automatic_Taxonomy_Construction_NNs/src/graph_rag then run:
```bash
python graphRAG.py
```
This will print out an answer from the LLM based on the cypher query template inputted, graph Schema, and question provided.

- **FinalGraphRAG.ipynb**  
  A research environment designed for testing and adding additional code to `graphRAG.py`. It offers an easier way to visualize the knowledge base.
