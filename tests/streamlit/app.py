        We are a research project for the Computer Science & Engineering [capstone program](https://www.unr.edu/engineering/student-resources/innovation-day/get-involved) at University of Nevada, Reno.
                    
        We present the newest tool for classifying & visualizing neural networks. We can classify, detail, visualize & summarize all things machine learning.
        We utilize a hierarchical organization technique called a taxonomy to organize the structures of neural networks. Think of the tree of life, with all living
        things in a hierarchy, perfectly organized for understanding what comes from where, and what it may relate to. Our tool will provide this organization, but
        for neural networks. You may be wondering what kind of inputs are compatible with this tool. Poorly documented code? We can classify it. Lengthy academic
        papers? We got you covered. Just have weights & biases saved? You bet your buns we can do that too.
