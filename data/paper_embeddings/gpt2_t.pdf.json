We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.",

Introduction\n\nMachine learning systems now excel (in expectation) at tasks they are trained for by using a combination of large datasets, high-capacity models, and supervised learning (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) (Sutskever et al., 2014) (Amodei et al., 2016). Yet these systems are brittle and sensitive to slight changes in the data distribution (Recht et al., 2018) and task specification (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). Current systems are better characterized as narrow experts rather than\n\ncompetent generalists. We would like to move towards more general systems which can perform many tasks - eventually without the need to manually create and label a training dataset for each one.\n\nThe dominant approach to creating ML systems is to collect a dataset of training examples demonstrating correct behavior for a desired task, train a system to imitate these behaviors, and then test its performance on independent and identically distributed (IID) held-out examples. This has served well to make progress on narrow experts. But the often erratic behavior of captioning models (Lake et al., 2017), reading comprehension systems (Jia &amp; Liang, 2017), and image classifiers (Alcorn et al., 2018) on the diversity and variety of possible inputs highlights some of the shortcomings of this approach.\n\nOur suspicion is that the prevalence of single task training on single domain datasets is a major contributor to the lack of generalization observed in current systems. Progress towards robust systems with current architectures is likely to require training and measuring performance on a wide range of domains and tasks. Recently, several benchmarks have been proposed such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and decaNLP (McCann et al., 2018) to begin studying this.\n\nMultitask learning (Caruana, 1997) is a promising framework for improving general performance. However, multitask training in NLP is still nascent. Recent work reports modest performance improvements (Yogatama et al., 2019) and the two most ambitious efforts to date have trained on a total of 10 and 17 (dataset, objective) pairs respectively (McCann et al., 2018) (Bowman et al., 2018). From a meta-learning perspective, each (dataset, objective) pair is a single training example sampled from the distribution of datasets and objectives. Current ML systems need hundreds to thousands of examples to induce functions which generalize well. This suggests that multitask training many need just as many effective training pairs to realize its promise with current approaches. It will be very difficult to continue to scale the creation of datasets and the design of objectives to the degree that may be required to brute force our way there with current techniques. This motivates exploring additional setups for performing multitask learning.\n\nThe current best performing systems on language tasks\n\nFigure 1. Zero-shot task performance of WebText LMs as a function of model size on many NLP tasks. Reading Comprehension results are on CoQA (Reddy et al., 2018), translation on WMT-14 Fr-En (Artetxe et al., 2017), summarization on CNN and Daily Mail (See et al., 2017), and Question Answering on Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Section 3 contains detailed descriptions of each result.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nutilize a combination of pre-training and supervised finetuning. This approach has a long history with a trend towards more flexible forms of transfer. First, word vectors were learned and used as inputs to task-specific architectures (Mikolov et al., 2013) (Collobert et al., 2011), then the contextual representations of recurrent networks were transferred (Dai &amp; Le, 2015) (Peters et al., 2018), and recent work suggests that task-specific architectures are no longer necessary and transferring many self-attention blocks is sufficient (Radford et al., 2018) (Devlin et al., 2018).\n\nThese methods still require supervised training in order to perform a task. When only minimal or no supervised data is available, another line of work has demonstrated the promise of language models to perform specific tasks, such as commonsense reasoning (Schwartz et al., 2017) and sentiment analysis (Radford et al., 2017).\n\nIn this paper, we connect these two lines of work and continue the trend of more general methods of transfer. We demonstrate language models can perform down-stream tasks in a zero-shot setting - without any parameter or architecture modification. We demonstrate this approach shows potential by highlighting the ability of language models to perform a wide range of tasks in a zero-shot setting. We achieve promising, competitive, and state of the art results depending on the task.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Approach\n\nAt the core of our approach is language modeling. Language modeling is usually framed as unsupervised distribution estimation from a set of examples ( x , x 1 2 , ..., x n ) each composed of variable length sequences of symbols ( s , s 1 2 , ..., s n ) . Since language has a natural sequential ordering, it is common to factorize the joint probabilities over\n\nsymbols as the product of conditional probabilities (Jelinek &amp;Mercer, 1980) (Bengio et al., 2003):\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThis approach allows for tractable sampling from and estimation of p x ( ) as well as any conditionals of the form p s ( n -k , ..., s n | s , ..., s 1 n - -k 1 ) . In recent years, there have been significant improvements in the expressiveness of models that can compute these conditional probabilities, such as self-attention architectures like the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).\n\nLearning to perform a single task can be expressed in a probabilistic framework as estimating a conditional distribution p output input ( | ) . Since a general system should be able to perform many different tasks, even for the same input, it should condition not only on the input but also on the task to be performed. That is, it should model p output input, task ( | ) . This has been variously formalized in multitask and meta-learning settings. Task conditioning is often implemented at an architectural level, such as the task specific encoders and decoders in (Kaiser et al., 2017) or at an algorithmic level such as the inner and outer loop optimization framework of MAML (Finn et al., 2017). But as exemplified in McCann et al. (2018), language provides a flexible way to specify tasks, inputs, and outputs all as a sequence of symbols. For example, a translation training example can be written as the sequence (translate to french, english text, french text) . Likewise, a reading comprehension training example can be written as (answer the question, document, question, answer) . McCann et al. (2018) demonstrated it was possible to train a single model, the MQAN,\n\nto infer and perform many different tasks on examples with this type of format.\n\nLanguage modeling is also able to, in principle, learn the tasks of McCann et al. (2018) without the need for explicit supervision of which symbols are the outputs to be predicted. Since the supervised objective is the the same as the unsupervised objective but only evaluated on a subset of the sequence, the global minimum of the unsupervised objective is also the global minimum of the supervised objective. In this slightly toy setting, the concerns with density estimation as a principled training objective discussed in (Sutskever et al., 2015) are side stepped. The problem instead becomes whether we are able to, in practice, optimize the unsupervised objective to convergence. Preliminary experiments confirmed that sufficiently large language models are able to perform multitask learning in this toy-ish setup but learning is much slower than in explicitly supervised approaches.\n\nWhile it is a large step from the well-posed setup described above to the messiness of 'language in the wild', Weston (2016) argues, in the context of dialog, for the need to develop systems capable of learning from natural language directly and demonstrated a proof of concept - learning a QAtask without a reward signal by using forward prediction of a teacher's outputs. While dialog is an attractive approach, we worry it is overly restrictive. The internet contains a vast amount of information that is passively available without the need for interactive communication. Our speculation is that a language model with sufficient capacity will begin to learn to infer and perform the tasks demonstrated in natural language sequences in order to better predict them, regardless of their method of procurement. If a language model is able to do this it will be, in effect, performing unsupervised multitask learning. We test whether this is the case by analyzing the performance of language models in a zero-shot setting on a wide variety of tasks.",

Training Dataset\n\nMost prior work trained language models on a single domain of text, such as news articles (Jozefowicz et al., 2016), Wikipedia (Merity et al., 2016), or fiction books (Kiros et al., 2015). Our approach motivates building as large and diverse a dataset as possible in order to collect natural language demonstrations of tasks in as varied of domains and contexts as possible.\n\nA promising source of diverse and nearly unlimited text is web scrapes such as Common Crawl. While these archives are many orders of magnitude larger than current language modeling datasets, they have significant data quality issues. Trinh &amp; Le (2018) used Common Crawl in their work on commonsense reasoning but noted a large amount of documents 'whose content are mostly unintelligible'. We observed similar data issues in our initial experiments with\n\n'I'm not the cleverest man in the world, but like they say in French: Je ne suis pas un imbecile [I'm not a fool].\n\nIn a now-deleted post from Aug. 16, Soheil Eid, Tory candidate in the riding of Joliette, wrote in French: ' Mentez mentez, il en restera toujours quelque chose ,' which translates as, ' Lie lie and something will always remain. '\n\n'I hate the word ' perfume ,'' Burr says. 'It's somewhat better in French: ' parfum .'\n\nIf listened carefully at 29:55, a conversation can be heard between two guys in French: ' -Comment on fait pour aller de l'autre cot' e? -Quel autre cot' e? ', which means ' - How do you get to the other side? - What side? '.\n\nIf this sounds like a bit of a stretch, consider this question in French: As-tu aller au cin' ema? , or Did you go to the movies? , which literally translates as Have-you to go to movies/theater?\n\n' Brevet Sans Garantie Du Gouvernement ', translated to English: ' Patented without government warranty '.\n\nTable 1. Examples of naturally occurring demonstrations of English to French and French to English translation found throughout the WebText training set.\n\nCommon Crawl. Trinh &amp; Le (2018)'s best results were achieved using a small subsample of Common Crawl which included only documents most similar to their target dataset, the Winograd Schema Challenge. While this is a pragmatic approach to improve performance on a specific task, we want to avoid making assumptions about the tasks to be performed ahead of time.\n\nInstead, we created a new web scrape which emphasizes document quality. To do this we only scraped web pages which have been curated/filtered by humans. Manually filtering a full web scrape would be exceptionally expensive so as a starting point, we scraped all outbound links from Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3 karma. This can be thought of as a heuristic indicator for whether other users found the link interesting, educational, or just funny.\n\nThe resulting dataset, WebText, contains the text subset of these 45 million links. To extract the text from HTML responses we use a combination of the Dragnet (Peters &amp; Lecocq, 2013) and Newspaper 1 content extractors. All results presented in this paper use a preliminary version of WebText which does not include links created after Dec 2017 and which after de-duplication and some heuristic based cleaning contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 GB of text. We removed all Wikipedia documents from WebText since it is a common data source for other datasets and could complicate analysis due to over-\n\nlapping training data with test evaluation tasks.",

Current large scale LMs include pre-processing steps such as lowercasing, tokenization, and out-of-vocabulary tokens which restrict the space of model-able strings. While processing Unicode strings as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes elegantly fulfills this requirement as exemplified in work such as Gillick et al. (2015), current byte-level LMs are not competitive with word-level LMs on large scale datasets such as the One Billion Word Benchmark (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). We observed a similar performance gap in our own attempts to train standard byte-level LMs on WebText.\n\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015) is a practical middle ground between character and word level language modeling which effectively interpolates between word level inputs for frequent symbol sequences and character level inputs for infrequent symbol sequences. Despite its name, reference BPE implementations often operate on Unicode code points and not byte sequences. These implementations would require including the full space of Unicode symbols in order to model all Unicode strings. This would result in a base vocabulary of over 130,000 before any multi-symbol tokens are added. This is prohibitively large compared to the 32,000 to 64,000 token vocabularies often used with BPE. In contrast, a byte-level version of BPE only requires a base vocabulary of size 256. However, directly applying BPE to the byte sequence results in suboptimal merges due to BPE using a greedy frequency based heuristic for building the token vocabulary. We observed BPE including many versions of common words like dog since they occur in many variations such as dog. dog! dog? . This results in a sub-optimal allocation of limited vocabulary slots and model capacity. To avoid this, we prevent BPE from merging across character categories for any byte sequence. We add an exception for spaces which significantly improves the compression efficiency while adding only minimal fragmentation of words across multiple vocab tokens.\n\nThis input representation allows us to combine the empirical benefits of word-level LMs with the generality of byte-level approaches. Since our approach can assign a probability to any Unicode string, this allows us to evaluate our LMs on any dataset regardless of pre-processing, tokenization, or vocab size.",

Language Modeling\n\nAs an initial step towards zero-shot task transfer, we are interested in understanding how WebText LM's perform at zero-shot domain transfer on the primary task they are trained for - language modeling. Since our model operates on a byte level and does not require lossy pre-processing or tokenization, we can evaluate it on any language model benchmark. Results on language modeling datasets are commonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or exponentiated version of the average negative log probability per canonical prediction unit - usually a character, a byte, or a word. We evaluate the same quantity by computing the log-probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and dividing by the number of canonical units. For many of these datasets, WebText LMs would be tested significantly outof-distribution, having to predict aggressively standardized text, tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation and contractions, shuffled sentences, and even the string\n\nLanguage Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners\n\n|       |   LAMBADA (PPL) |   LAMBADA (ACC) |   CBT-CN (ACC) |   CBT-NE (ACC) |   WikiText2 (PPL) |   PTB (PPL) |   enwik8 (BPB) |   text8 (BPC) |   WikiText103 (PPL) |   1BW (PPL) |\n|-------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| SOTA  |           99.8  |           59.23 |          85.7  |          82.3  |             39.14 |       46.54 |           0.99 |          1.08 |               18.3  |      21.8   |\n| 117M  |           35.13 |           45.99 |          87.65 |          83.4  |             29.41 |       65.85 |           1.16 |          1.17 |               37.5  |      75.2   |\n| 345M  |           15.6  |           55.48 |          92.35 |          87.1  |             22.76 |       47.33 |           1.01 |          1.06 |               26.37 |      55.72  |\n| 762M  |           10.87 |           60.12 |          93.45 |          88    |             19.93 |       40.31 |           0.97 |          1.02 |               22.05 |      44.575 |\n| 1542M |            8.63 |           63.24 |          93.3  |          89.05 |             18.34 |       35.76 |           0.93 |          0.98 |               17.48 |      42.16  |\n\nTable 3.

Large improvements are also noticed on datasets created to measure long-term dependencies like LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016) and the Children's Book Test (Hill et al., 2015). Our model is still significantly worse than prior work on the One Billion Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013).

We use the first 3 generated sentences in these 100 tokens as the summary.

Performance on this task was surprising to us, since we deliberately removed non-English webpages from WebText as a filtering step. In order to confirm this, we ran a byte-level language detector 2 on WebText which detected only 10MB of data in the French language which is approximately 500x smaller than the monolingual French corpus common in prior unsupervised machine translation research.",

Question Answering\n\nA potential way to test what information is contained within a language model is to evaluate how often it generates the correct answer to factoid-style questions. Previous showcasing of this behavior in neural systems where all information is stored in parameters such as A Neural Conversational Model (Vinyals &amp; Le, 2015) reported qualitative results due to the lack of high-quality evaluation datasets. The recently introduced Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al.,\n\n2019) is a promising resource to test this more quantitatively. Similar to translation, the context of the language model is seeded with example question answer pairs which helps the model infer the short answer style of the dataset. GPT-2 answers 4.1% of questions correctly when evaluated by the exact match metric commonly used on reading comprehension datasets like SQUAD. 3 As a comparison point, the smallest model does not exceed the 1.0% accuracy of an incredibly simple baseline which returns the most common answer for each question type (who, what, where, etc...). GPT-2 answers 5.3 times more questions correctly, suggesting that model capacity has been a major factor in the poor performance of neural systems on this kind of task as of yet. The probability GPT-2 assigns to its generated answers is well calibrated and GPT-2 has an accuracy of 63.1% on the 1% of questions it is most confident in. The 30 most confident answers generated by GPT-2 on development set questions are shown in Table 5. The performance of GPT-2 is still much, much, worse than the 30 to 50% range of open domain question answering systems which hybridize information retrieval with extractive document question answering (Alberti et al., 2019).\n\nTable 6.

        "page_content": "## 4. Generalization vs Memorization\n\nRecent work in computer vision has shown that common image datasets contain a non-trivial amount of near-duplicate images. For instance CIFAR-10 has 3.3% overlap between train and test images (Barz &amp; Denzler, 2019). This results in an over-reporting of the generalization performance of machine learning systems. As the size of datasets increases this issue becomes increasingly likely which suggests a similar phenomena could be happening with WebText. Therefore it is important to analyze how much test data also shows up in the training data.\n\nTo study this we created Bloom filters containing 8-grams of WebText training set tokens. To improve recall, strings were normalized to contain only lower-cased alphanumeric words with a single space as a delimiter. The Bloom filters were constructed such that the false positive rate is upper bounded by 1 10 8 . We further verified the low false positive rate by generating 1M strings, of which zero were found by the filter.\n\nThese Bloom filters let us calculate, given a dataset, the percentage of 8-grams from that dataset that are also found in the WebText training set. Table 6 shows this overlap analysis for the test sets of common LM benchmarks. Common LMdatasets' test sets have between 1-6% overlap with WebText train, with an average of overlap of 3.2%. Somewhat surprisingly, many datasets have larger overlaps with their own training splits, with an average of 5.9% overlap.\n\nOur approach optimizes for recall, and while manual inspection of the overlaps shows many common phrases, there are many longer matches that are due to duplicated data. This is not unique to WebText. For instance, we discovered that the test set of WikiText-103 has an article which is also in the training dataset. Since there are only 60 articles in the test set there is at least an overlap of 1.6%. 4 Potentially more worryingly, 1BW has an overlap of nearly 13.2% with its own training set according to our procedure.\n\nFor the Winograd Schema Challenge, we found only 10 schemata which had any 8-gram overlaps with the WebText training set. Of these, 2 were spurious matches. Of the remaining 8, only 1 schema appeared in any contexts that\n\ngave away the answer.\n\nFor CoQA, about 15% of documents in the news domain are already in WebText and the model performs about 3 F1 better on these. CoQA's development set metric reports the average performance over 5 different domains and we measure a gain of about 0.5-1.0 F1 due to overlap across the various domains. However, no actual training questions or answers are in WebText since CoQA was released after the cutoff date for links in WebText.\n\nOn LAMBADA, the average overlap is 1.2%. GPT-2 performs about 2 perplexity better on examples with greater than 15% overlap. Recalculating metrics when excluding all examples with any overlap shifts results from 8.6 to 8.7 perplexity and reduces accuracy from 63.2% to 62.9%. This very small change in overall results is likely due to only 1 in 200 examples having significant overlap.\n\nOverall, our analysis suggests that data overlap between WebText training data and specific evaluation datasets provides a small but consistent benefit to reported results. However, for most datasets we do not notice significantly larger overlaps than those already existing between standard training and test sets, as Table 6 highlights.\n\nUnderstanding and quantifying how highly similar text impacts performance is an important research question. Better de-duplication techniques such as scalable fuzzy matching could also help better answer these questions. For now, we recommend the use of n-gram overlap based de-duplication as an important verification step and sanity check during the creation of training and test splits for new NLP datasets.\n\nAnother potential way of determining whether the performance of WebText LMs is attributable to memorization is inspecting their performance on their own held-out set. As shown in Figure 4, performance on both the training and test sets of WebText are similar and improve together as model size is increased. This suggests even GPT-2 is still underfitting on WebText in many ways.\n\nGPT-2 is also able to write news articles about the discovery of talking unicorns. An example is provided in Table 13.",

Discussion\n\nMuch research has been dedicated to learning (Hill et al., 2016), understanding (Levy &amp; Goldberg, 2014), and critically evaluating (Wieting &amp; Kiela, 2019) the representations of both supervised and unsupervised pre-training methods. Our results suggest that unsupervised task learning is an additional promising area of research to explore. These findings potentially help explain the widespread success of pre-training techniques for down-stream NLP tasks as we show that, in the limit, one of these pre-training techniques begins to learn to perform tasks directly without the need for supervised adaption or modification.\n\nOn reading comprehension the performance of GPT-2 is competitive with supervised baselines in a zero-shot setting. However, on other tasks such as summarization, while it is qualitatively performing the task, its performance is still only rudimentary according to quantitative metrics. While suggestive as a research result, in terms of practical applications, the zero-shot performance of GPT-2 is still far from use-able.\n\nWe have studied the zero-shot performance of WebText LMs on many canonical NLP tasks, but there are many additional tasks that could be evaluated. There are undoubtedly many practical tasks where the performance of GPT-2 is still no better than random. Even on common tasks that we evaluated on, such as question answering and translation, language models only begin to outperform trivial baselines when they have sufficient capacity.\n\nWhile zero-shot performance establishes a baseline of the potential performance of GPT-2 on many tasks, it is not clear where the ceiling is with finetuning. On some tasks, GPT-2's fully abstractive output is a significant departure from the extractive pointer network (Vinyals et al., 2015) based outputs which are currently state of the art on many question answering and reading comprehension datasets. Given the prior success of fine-tuning GPT, we plan to investigate fine-tuning on benchmarks such as decaNLP and GLUE, especially since it is unclear whether the additional\n\ntraining data and capacity of GPT-2 is sufficient to overcome the inefficiencies of uni-directional representations demonstrated by BERT (Devlin et al., 2018).",

For example, when conditioned on the first sentence and a half of the Gettysburg Address (which occurs approximately 40 times throughout WebText), an argmax decode from GPT-2 recovers the speech. Even when sampling without truncation, we find that the model copies the speech for awhile before drifting, albeit in a similar style. It typically drifts within 100-200 tokens, and displays widening diversity once it drifts.\n\nTo quantify how often exact memorization shows up in samples, we generated samples from GPT-2 conditioned on WebText test set articles and compared the overlap rates of GPT-2's generations to the overlap rates of the ground-truth completions. The results of this analysis are shown below and suggest that GPT-2 repeats text from the training set less often then the baseline rate of held-out articles.\n\n8-gram overlap with training set\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 5.

It's like a summer version of this Jake Grantham outfit; in fact, my shoes are close to the colors of his Nike Racers! Instead of a heavy Harris Tweed jacket and denim shirt, I'm wearing a cotton DB jacket and and a linen shirt. Both fabrics (in these colors) are an absolute must for summer, as they go with both dark and and light pants! As you can see, they pair wonderfully with the dark jeans and shoes. It's a pseudo menswear/prep outfit.\n\nOverall, this is a very casual outfit which is why I paired my sneakers with it. I'm not about wearing a full wool suit with sneakers (as GQ shows a lot) but I'm definitely open to keeping things casual, like this cotton DB. Casual fabrics are key to pulling off your sneakers in a dressed down menswear outfit. I'd even suggest to wear these sneakers with a khaki chino suit or a white linen suit.

Overall, it's a classic turtleneck, with nothing too flashy. I did swap my shoes for these ASICS Tiger Killshots and I wish I hadn't did that. The shoe itself is very comfortable, however, I found that wearing them in these sneakers made my feet look a bit larger. I'd wear them with denim, chinos, whatever, but would never recommend wearing them alone. There are just too many variables involved.\n\nOutfit 3: Dress\n\nThis is the final outfit I wore the ASICS Tiger Killshots. This version of the ASICS is a much more modern and streamlined version. The shoe has the most modern and minimal design that I can think of! With a lot of black, these sneakers look very cool.

Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.\n\nGPT-2: The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid's Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.\n\nNow, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.\n\nDr. Jorge P' erez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. P' erez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.\n\nP' erez and the others then ventured further into the valley. 'By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,' said P' erez.\n\nP' erez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them - they were so close they could touch their horns.\n\nWhile examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. P' erez stated, 'We can see, for example, that they have a common 'language,' something like a dialect or dialectic.'\n\nDr. P' erez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.\n\nWhile their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to P' erez, 'In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.'\n\nHowever, P' erez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. 'But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,' said the scientist.\n\nArticle: Prehistoric man sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave in modern day France 36,000 years ago.\n\nNow, with the help of cutting-edge technology, those works of art in the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave have been reproduced to create the biggest replica cave in the world.\n\nThe manmade cavern named the Caverne du Pont-d'Arc has been built a few miles from the original site in Vallon-Pont-D'arc in Southern France and contains 1,000 painstakingly-reproduced drawings as well as around 450 bones and other features...\n\nCavemen and women sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave 36,000 years ago and now a replica has been created (pictured)\n\n...\n\nGPT-2: The original site in Vallon-Pont-D'arc in Southern France is a Unesco World Heritage site and is the oldest known and the best preserved cave decorated by man.

The cave contains images of 14 different species of animals including woolly rhinoceros, mammoths, and big cats.\n\nReference: Cave mimics famous Caverne du Pont-d'Arc in France, the oldest cave decorated by man and the best preserved.

And it seems the oligarch and Chelsea FC owner, whose submarine is just one of the extras that came with his £ 300million superyacht Eclipse (perfect for getting to shore undetected), is not the only wealthy businessman splashing out on underwater exploration.\n\nDubbed Earth's real 'final frontier', the oceans are still so little-explored that billionaires are queuing up to buy vessels that give them a glimpse of the dramatic seascapes and incredible wildlife of the world's oceans.\n\nSo if you have a spare few million in the bank and want some holiday snaps and Instagram posts that will really trump everyone else, you may want to snap up one of these...\n\nWhale of a time: The OrcaSub takes you 2000 feet beneath the surface in two pressurised Perspex viewing domes for optimum exploration\n\n...\n\nGPT-2: The U-Boat Worx submarine can dive to 984 feet (300 metres) and is capable of diving to the bottom of the ocean. It can be used for diving, snorkelling and even snorkel diving.

Only a few months old, this is the baby girl whose ears she desperately tried to cover the night the aerial bombardment started. She lay awake, she says, in a village mosque on the Yemeni island of Birim, counting explosions as the baby cried.\n\nIt could have been worse though. They could have still been in their house when the first missile landed. 'Our neighbor shouted to my husband 'you have to leave, they're coming.' And we just ran. As soon as we left the house, the first missile fell right by it and then a second on it. It burned everything to the ground,' Qassim tells us\n\n...\n\nGPT-2: Yemen is in the middle of a civil war.

Plans for the relay were announced on April 26, 2007, in Beijing, China. The relay, also called by the organizers as the 'Journey of Harmony', lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi) - the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 Summer Olympics.\n\nAfter being lit at the birthplace of the Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece on March 24, the torch trav- eled to the Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on March 31. From Beijing, the torch was following a route passing through six continents. The torch has visited cities along the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. The relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of Mount Everest on the border of Nepal and Tibet, China from the Chinese side, which was closed specially for the event.\n\n- Q: What was the theme\n- A: 'one world, one dream'.\n- Q: What was the length of the race?\n- A: 137,000 km\n- Q: Was it larger than previous ones?\n- A: No\n- Q: Where did the race begin?\n- A: Olympia, Greece\n- Q: Is there anything notable about that place?\n- A: birthplace of Olympic Games\n- Q: Where did they go after?\n- A: Athens\n- Q: How many days was the race?\n- A: seven\n- Q: Did they visit any notable landmarks?\n- A: Panathinaiko Stadium\n- Q: And did they climb any mountains?\n\nA:\n\nModel answer :\n\nEverest\n\nTurker answers :\n\nunknown, yes, Yes, yes",

He moves around her office at work and goes shopping with her. 'Most people don't seem to mind Tom,' says Catherine, who thinks he is wonderful. 'He's my fourth child,' she says. She may think of him and treat him that way as her son. He moves around buying his food, paying his health bills and his taxes, but in fact Tom is a dog.\n\nCatherine and Tom live in Sweden, a country where everyone is expected to lead an orderly life accord- ing to rules laid down by the government, which also provides a high level of care for its people. This level of care costs money.\n\nPeople in Sweden pay taxes on everything, so aren't surprised to find that owning a dog means more taxes. Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to keep their dog, which is spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment for a dog that falls ill. However, most such treatment is expensive, so owners often decide to offer health and even life for their dog.\n\nIn Sweden dog owners must pay for any damage their dog does. A Swedish Kennel Club official ex- plains what this means: if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car, you, as the owner, have to pay for any damage done to the car, even if your dog has been killed in the accident.\n\nQ: How old is Catherine?\n\nA: 54\n\nQ: where does she live?\n\nA:\n\nModel answer :\n\nStockholm\n\nTurker answers : Sweden, Sweden, in Sweden, Sweden\n\nTable 17.
