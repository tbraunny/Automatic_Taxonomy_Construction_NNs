Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/highlevel features [49] and classifiers in an end-to-end multilayer fashion, and the 'levels' of features can be enriched by the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence [40, 43] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance, and the leading results [40, 43, 12, 16] on the challenging ImageNet dataset [35] all exploit 'very deep' [40] models, with a depth of sixteen [40] to thirty [16]. Many other nontrivial visual recognition tasks [7, 11, 6, 32, 27] have also\n\n1 http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/ and http://mscoco.org/dataset/#detections-challenge2015 .\n\nFigure 1. Training error (left) and test error (right) on CIFAR-10 with 20-layer and 56-layer 'plain' networks. The deeper network has higher training error, and thus test error. Similar phenomena on ImageNet is presented in Fig. 4.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngreatly benefited from very deep models.\n\nDriven by the significance of depth, a question arises: Is learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers? An obstacle to answering this question was the notorious problem of vanishing/exploding gradients [14, 1, 8], which hamper convergence from the beginning. This problem, however, has been largely addressed by normalized initialization [23, 8, 36, 12] and intermediate normalization layers [16], which enable networks with tens of layers to start converging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation [22].\n\nWhen deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. Unexpectedly, such degradation is not caused by overfitting , and adding more layers to a suitably deep model leads to higher training error , as reported in [10, 41] and thoroughly verified by our experiments. Fig. 1 shows a typical example.\n\nThe degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that not all systems are similarly easy to optimize. Let us consider a shallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds more layers onto it. There exists a solution by construction to the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping, and the other layers are copied from the learned shallower model. The existence of this constructed solution indicates that a deeper model should produce no higher training error than its shallower counterpart. But experiments show that our current solvers on hand are unable to find solutions that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 2. Residual learning: a building block.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare comparably good or better than the constructed solution (or unable to do so in feasible time).\n\nIn this paper, we address the degradation problem by introducing a deep residual learning framework. Instead of hoping each few stacked layers directly fit a desired underlying mapping, we explicitly let these layers fit a residual mapping. Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as H ( x ) , we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of F ( x ) := H ( x ) -x . The original mapping is recast into F ( x )+ x . Wehypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.\n\nThe formulation of F ( x ) + x can be realized by feedforward neural networks with 'shortcut connections' (Fig. 2). Shortcut connections [2, 33, 48] are those skipping one or more layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply perform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. 2). Identity shortcut connections add neither extra parameter nor computational complexity. The entire network can still be trained end-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be easily implemented using common libraries ( e.g ., Caffe [19]) without modifying the solvers.\n\nWe present comprehensive experiments on ImageNet [35] to show the degradation problem and evaluate our method. We show that: 1) Our extremely deep residual nets are easy to optimize, but the counterpart 'plain' nets (that simply stack layers) exhibit higher training error when the depth increases; 2) Our deep residual nets can easily enjoy accuracy gains from greatly increased depth, producing results substantially better than previous networks.\n\nSimilar phenomena are also shown on the CIFAR-10 set [20], suggesting that the optimization difficulties and the effects of our method are not just akin to a particular dataset. We present successfully trained models on this dataset with over 100 layers, and explore models with over 1000 layers.\n\nOn the ImageNet classification dataset [35], we obtain excellent results by extremely deep residual nets. Our 152layer residual net is the deepest network ever presented on ImageNet, while still having lower complexity than VGG nets [40]. Our ensemble has 3.57% top-5 error on the\n\nImageNet test set, and won the 1st place in the ILSVRC 2015 classification competition . The extremely deep representations also have excellent generalization performance on other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the 1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC &amp; COCO 2015 competitions. This strong evidence shows that the residual learning principle is generic, and we expect that it is applicable in other vision and non-vision problems.",

Residual Learning\n\nLet us consider H ( x ) as an underlying mapping to be fit by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net), with x denoting the inputs to the first of these layers. If one hypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptotically approximate complicated functions , then it is equiv2 alent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approximate the residual functions, i.e ., H ( x ) -x (assuming that the input and output are of the same dimensions). So rather than expect stacked layers to approximate H ( x ) , we explicitly let these layers approximate a residual function F ( x ) := H ( x ) -x . The original function thus becomes F ( x )+ x . Although both forms should be able to asymptotically approximate the desired functions (as hypothesized), the ease of learning might be different.\n\nThis reformulation is motivated by the counterintuitive phenomena about the degradation problem (Fig. 1, left). As we discussed in the introduction, if the added layers can be constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should have training error no greater than its shallower counterpart. The degradation problem suggests that the solvers might have difficulties in approximating identity mappings by multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning reformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers may simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear layers toward zero to approach identity mappings.\n\nIn real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are optimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the problem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity mapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the solver to find the perturbations with reference to an identity mapping, than to learn the function as a new one. We show by experiments (Fig. 7) that the learned residual functions in general have small responses, suggesting that identity mappings provide reasonable preconditioning.",

Formally, in this paper we consider a building block defined as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nHere x and y are the input and output vectors of the layers considered. The function F ( x , { W i } ) represents the residual mapping to be learned. For the example in Fig. 2 that has two layers, F = W σ W 2 ( 1 x ) in which σ denotes\n\n2 This hypothesis, however, is still an open question. See [28].\n\nReLU [29] and the biases are omitted for simplifying notations. The operation F + x is performed by a shortcut connection and element-wise addition. We adopt the second nonlinearity after the addition ( i.e ., σ ( y ) , see Fig. 2).\n\nThe shortcut connections in Eqn.(1) introduce neither extra parameter nor computation complexity. This is not only attractive in practice but also important in our comparisons between plain and residual networks. We can fairly compare plain/residual networks that simultaneously have the same number of parameters, depth, width, and computational cost (except for the negligible element-wise addition).\n\nThe dimensions of x and F must be equal in Eqn.(1). If this is not the case ( e.g ., when changing the input/output channels), we can perform a linear projection W s by the shortcut connections to match the dimensions:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nWe can also use a square matrix W s in Eqn.(1). But we will show by experiments that the identity mapping is sufficient for addressing the degradation problem and is economical, and thus W s is only used when matching dimensions.\n\nThe form of the residual function F is flexible. Experiments in this paper involve a function F that has two or three layers (Fig. 5), while more layers are possible. But if F has only a single layer, Eqn.(1) is similar to a linear layer: y = W 1 x + x , for which we have not observed advantages.\n\nWe also note that although the above notations are about fully-connected layers for simplicity, they are applicable to convolutional layers. The function F ( x , { W i } ) can represent multiple convolutional layers. The element-wise addition is performed on two feature maps, channel by channel.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3. Network Architectures\n\nWe have tested various plain/residual nets, and have observed consistent phenomena. To provide instances for discussion, we describe two models for ImageNet as follows.\n\nPlain Network. Our plain baselines (Fig. 3, middle) are mainly inspired by the philosophy of VGG nets [40] (Fig. 3, left). The convolutional layers mostly have 3 × 3 filters and follow two simple design rules: (i) for the same output feature map size, the layers have the same number of filters; and (ii) if the feature map size is halved, the number of filters is doubled so as to preserve the time complexity per layer. We perform downsampling directly by convolutional layers that have a stride of 2. The network ends with a global average pooling layer and a 1000-way fully-connected layer with softmax. The total number of weighted layers is 34 in Fig. 3 (middle).\n\nIt is worth noticing that our model has fewer filters and lower complexity than VGG nets [40] (Fig. 3, left). Our 34layer baseline has 3.6 billion FLOPs (multiply-adds), which is only 18% of VGG-19 (19.6 billion FLOPs).\n\nFigure 3. Example network architectures for ImageNet. Left : the VGG-19 model [40] (19.6 billion FLOPs) as a reference. Middle : a plain network with 34 parameter layers (3.6 billion FLOPs). Right : a residual network with 34 parameter layers (3.6 billion FLOPs). The dotted shortcuts increase dimensions. Table 1 shows more details and other variants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResidual Network. Based on the above plain network, we insert shortcut connections (Fig. 3, right) which turn the network into its counterpart residual version. The identity shortcuts (Eqn.(1)) can be directly used when the input and output are of the same dimensions (solid line shortcuts in Fig. 3). When the dimensions increase (dotted line shortcuts in Fig. 3), we consider two options: (A) The shortcut still performs identity mapping, with extra zero entries padded for increasing dimensions. This option introduces no extra parameter; (B) The projection shortcut in Eqn.(2) is used to match dimensions (done by 1 × 1 convolutions). For both options, when the shortcuts go across feature maps of two sizes, they are performed with a stride of 2.",

The image is resized with its shorter side randomly sampled in [256 480] , for scale augmentation [40]. A 224 × 224 crop is randomly sampled from an image or its horizontal flip, with the per-pixel mean subtracted [21]. The standard color augmentation in [21] is used. We adopt batch normalization (BN) [16] right after each convolution and before activation, following [16]. We initialize the weights as in [12] and train all plain/residual nets from scratch. We use SGD with a mini-batch size of 256. The learning rate starts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus, and the models are trained for up to 60 × 10 4 iterations. We use a weight decay of 0.0001 and a momentum of 0.9. We do not use dropout [13], following the practice in [16].\n\nIn testing, for comparison studies we adopt the standard 10-crop testing [21]. For best results, we adopt the fullyconvolutional form as in [40, 12], and average the scores at multiple scales (images are resized such that the shorter side is in { 224 256 384 480 640 , , , , } ).",

Fig. 4 shows the training procedures.\n\n34-layer plain net has higher training error throughout the whole training procedure, even though the solution space of the 18-layer plain network is a subspace of that of the 34-layer one.\n\nWe argue that this optimization difficulty is unlikely to be caused by vanishing gradients. These plain networks are trained with BN [16], which ensures forward propagated signals to have non-zero variances. We also verify that the backward propagated gradients exhibit healthy norms with BN. So neither forward nor backward signals vanish. In fact, the 34-layer plain net is still able to achieve competitive accuracy (Table 3), suggesting that the solver works to some extent. We conjecture that the deep plain nets may have exponentially low convergence rates, which impact the\n\nResidual Networks. Next we evaluate 18-layer and 34layer residual nets ( ResNets ). The baseline architectures are the same as the above plain nets, expect that a shortcut connection is added to each pair of 3 × 3 filters as in Fig. 3 (right). In the first comparison (Table 2 and Fig. 4 right), we use identity mapping for all shortcuts and zero-padding for increasing dimensions (option A). So they have no extra parameter compared to the plain counterparts.\n\nWe have three major observations from Table 2 and Fig. 4. First, the situation is reversed with residual learning - the 34-layer ResNet is better than the 18-layer ResNet (by 2.8%). More importantly, the 34-layer ResNet exhibits considerably lower training error and is generalizable to the validation data. This indicates that the degradation problem is well addressed in this setting and we manage to obtain accuracy gains from increased depth.\n\nSecond, compared to its plain counterpart, the 34-layer\n\n3 We have experimented with more training iterations (3 × ) and still observed the degradation problem, suggesting that this problem cannot be feasibly addressed by simply using more iterations.\n\n| model          | top-1 err.   |   top-5 err. |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| VGG-16 [40]    | 28.07        |         9.33 |\n| GoogLeNet [43] | -            |         9.15 |\n| PReLU-net [12] | 24.27        |         7.38 |\n| plain-34       | 28.54        |        10.02 |\n| ResNet-34 A    | 25.03        |         7.76 |\n| ResNet-34 B    | 24.52        |         7.46 |\n| ResNet-34 C    | 24.19        |         7.4  |\n| ResNet-50      | 22.85        |         6.71 |\n| ResNet-101     | 21.75        |         6.05 |\n| ResNet-152     | 21.43        |         5.71 |\n\nTable 3.

Error rates (%) of ensembles . The top-5 error is on the test set of ImageNet and reported by the test server.\n\nResNet reduces the top-1 error by 3.5% (Table 2), resulting from the successfully reduced training error (Fig. 4 right vs . left). This comparison verifies the effectiveness of residual learning on extremely deep systems.\n\nLast, we also note that the 18-layer plain/residual nets are comparably accurate (Table 2), but the 18-layer ResNet converges faster (Fig. 4 right vs . left). When the net is 'not overly deep' (18 layers here), the current SGD solver is still able to find good solutions to the plain net. In this case, the ResNet eases the optimization by providing faster convergence at the early stage.\n\nIdentity vs . Projection Shortcuts. We have shown that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 5. A deeper residual function F for ImageNet. Left: a building block (on 56 × 56 feature maps) as in Fig. 3 for ResNet34. Right: a 'bottleneck' building block for ResNet-50/101/152.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nparameter-free, identity shortcuts help with training. Next we investigate projection shortcuts (Eqn.(2)). In Table 3 we compare three options: (A) zero-padding shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and all shortcuts are parameterfree (the same as Table 2 and Fig. 4 right); (B) projection shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and other shortcuts are identity; and (C) all shortcuts are projections.\n\nTable 3 shows that all three options are considerably better than the plain counterpart. B is slightly better than A. We argue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A indeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than B, and we attribute this to the extra parameters introduced by many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small differences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we do not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce memory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are particularly important for not increasing the complexity of the bottleneck architectures that are introduced below.\n\nDeeper Bottleneck Architectures. Next we describe our deeper nets for ImageNet. Because of concerns on the training time that we can afford, we modify the building block as a bottleneck design 4 . For each residual function F , we use a stack of 3 layers instead of 2 (Fig. 5). The three layers are 1 × 1, 3 × 3, and 1 × 1 convolutions, where the 1 × 1 layers are responsible for reducing and then increasing (restoring) dimensions, leaving the 3 × 3 layer a bottleneck with smaller input/output dimensions. Fig. 5 shows an example, where both designs have similar time complexity.\n\nThe parameter-free identity shortcuts are particularly important for the bottleneck architectures. If the identity shortcut in Fig. 5 (right) is replaced with projection, one can show that the time complexity and model size are doubled, as the shortcut is connected to the two high-dimensional ends. So identity shortcuts lead to more efficient models for the bottleneck designs.\n\n50-layer ResNet: We replace each 2-layer block in the\n\n4 Deeper non -bottleneck ResNets ( e.g ., Fig. 5 left) also gain accuracy from increased depth (as shown on CIFAR-10), but are not as economical as the bottleneck ResNets. So the usage of bottleneck designs is mainly due to practical considerations. We further note that the degradation problem of plain nets is also witnessed for the bottleneck designs.\n\n34-layer net with this 3-layer bottleneck block, resulting in a 50-layer ResNet (Table 1). We use option B for increasing dimensions. This model has 3.8 billion FLOPs.\n\n101-layer and 152-layer ResNets: We construct 101layer and 152-layer ResNets by using more 3-layer blocks (Table 1). Remarkably, although the depth is significantly increased, the 152-layer ResNet (11.3 billion FLOPs) still has lower complexity than VGG-16/19 nets (15.3/19.6 billion FLOPs).\n\nThe 50/101/152-layer ResNets are more accurate than the 34-layer ones by considerable margins (Table 3 and 4). We do not observe the degradation problem and thus enjoy significant accuracy gains from considerably increased depth. The benefits of depth are witnessed for all evaluation metrics (Table 3 and 4).\n\nComparisons with State-of-the-art Methods. In Table 4 we compare with the previous best single-model results. Our baseline 34-layer ResNets have achieved very competitive accuracy. Our 152-layer ResNet has a single-model top-5 validation error of 4.49%. This single-model result outperforms all previous ensemble results (Table 5). We combine six models of different depth to form an ensemble (only with two 152-layer ones at the time of submitting). This leads to 3.57% top-5 error on the test set (Table 5). This entry won the 1st place in ILSVRC 2015.",

These models are trained with a minibatch size of 128 on two GPUs. We start with a learning rate of 0.1, divide it by 10 at 32k and 48k iterations, and terminate training at 64k iterations, which is determined on a 45k/5k train/val split. We follow the simple data augmentation in [24] for training: 4 pixels are padded on each side, and a 32 × 32 crop is randomly sampled from the padded image or its horizontal flip. For testing, we only evaluate the single view of the original 32 × 32 image.\n\nWe compare n = { 3 5 7 9 , , , } , leading to 20, 32, 44, and 56-layer networks. Fig. 6 (left) shows the behaviors of the plain nets. The deep plain nets suffer from increased depth, and exhibit higher training error when going deeper. This phenomenon is similar to that on ImageNet (Fig. 4, left) and on MNIST (see [41]), suggesting that such an optimization difficulty is a fundamental problem.\n\nFig. 6 (middle) shows the behaviors of ResNets. Also similar to the ImageNet cases (Fig. 4, right), our ResNets manage to overcome the optimization difficulty and demonstrate accuracy gains when the depth increases.\n\nWe further explore n = 18 that leads to a 110-layer ResNet. In this case, we find that the initial learning rate of 0.1 is slightly too large to start converging 5 . So we use 0.01 to warm up the training until the training error is below 80%(about 400 iterations), and then go back to 0.1 and continue training. The rest of the learning schedule is as done previously. This 110-layer network converges well (Fig. 6, middle). It has fewer parameters than other deep and thin\n\n5 With an initial learning rate of 0.1, it starts converging ( &lt; 90% error) after several epochs, but still reaches similar accuracy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\niter.

Fig. 7 shows the standard deviations (std) of the layer responses. The responses are the outputs of each 3 × 3 layer, after BN and before other nonlinearity (ReLU/addition). For ResNets, this analysis reveals the response strength of the residual functions. Fig. 7 shows that ResNets have generally smaller responses than their plain counterparts. These results support our basic motivation (Sec.3.1) that the residual functions might be generally closer to zero than the non-residual functions. We also notice that the deeper ResNet has smaller magnitudes of responses, as evidenced by the comparisons among ResNet-20, 56, and 110 in Fig. 7. When there are more layers, an individual layer of ResNets tends to modify the signal less.\n\nExploring Over 1000 layers. We explore an aggressively deep model of over 1000 layers. We set n = 200 that leads to a 1202-layer network, which is trained as described above. Our method shows no optimization difficulty , and this 10 3 -layer network is able to achieve training error &lt; 0.1% (Fig. 6, right). Its test error is still fairly good (7.93%, Table 6).\n\nBut there are still open problems on such aggressively deep models. The testing result of this 1202-layer network is worse than that of our 110-layer network, although both\n\nTable 7.

We argue that this is because of overfitting. The 1202-layer network may be unnecessarily large (19.4M) for this small dataset. Strong regularization such as maxout [9] or dropout [13] is applied to obtain the best results ([9, 25, 24, 34]) on this dataset. In this paper, we use no maxout/dropout and just simply impose regularization via deep and thin architectures by design, without distracting from the focus on the difficulties of optimization. But combining with stronger regularization may improve results, which we will study in the future.",
