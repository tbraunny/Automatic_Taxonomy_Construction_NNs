    ### Automatic Taxonomy Construction for Neural Networks

    We are a research project for the Computer Science & Engineering 
    [capstone program](https://www.unr.edu/engineering/student-resources/innovation-day/get-involved)
    at the University of Nevada, Reno.

    **TaxonNeuro** is your new best friend when it comes to classifying and visualizing neural networks.

    We classify, detail, visualize, and summarize all things machine learning.

    Our core methodology revolves around hierarchical organization â€” a technique called a 
    **taxonomy**. Think of it like the tree of life for neural networks: a clean, logical breakdown 
    of models and architectures, where everything has a place and a purpose.

    Got poorly documented code? Weâ€™ll classify it. Reading a dense academic paper? Weâ€™ve got you covered. 
    Just have saved weights & biases? You bet your buns we can work with that too.
