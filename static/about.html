            <p>Welcome to the About/Open Source page of Taxon Neuro.<br></p>
            <p>Taxon Neuro, the newest tool for classifying & visualizing neural networks. We can classify, detail, visualize & summarize all things machine learning. </p>
            <p>We utilize a hierarchical organization technique called a taxonomy to organize the structures of neural networks.</p>
            <p>Think of the tree of life, with all living things in a hierarchy, perfectly organized for understanding what comes from where, and what it may relate to. </p>
            <p>Our tool will provide this organization, but for neural networks. You may be wondering what kind of inputs are compatible with this tool. </p>
            <p>Poorly documented code? We can classify it. Lengthy academic papers? We got you covered. Just have weights & biases saved? You bet your buns we can do that too.</p>
            <p><br><br></p>
