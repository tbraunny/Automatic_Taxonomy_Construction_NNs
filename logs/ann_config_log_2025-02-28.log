Goal:
Answer the technical query by fusing the evidence from the provided context.

Query: 
Extract the input size information for the input layer of the convolutional network architecture. If the network accepts image data, the input size will be specified by its dimensions in the format 'WidthxHeightxChannels' (e.g., '64x64x1', '128x128x3', '512x512x3'). In this case, return the input dimensions as a string exactly in that format. If the network is not image-based, determine the total number of input units (neurons or nodes) and return that number as an integer. Your answer must be provided in JSON format with the key 'answer'.

Examples:
1. For an image-based network (e.g., a SVM) with input dimensions of 128x128x3:
{"answer": "128x128x3"}

2. For a network (e.g., a Generator) that takes a 100-dimensional vector as input:
{"answer": 100}

3. For a network (e.g., a Linear Regression model) with a single input feature:
{"answer": 1}

Now, for the following network:
Network: convolutional network
{"answer": "<Your Answer Here>"}Return Format:
First, provide a short explanation. Then on a new line, output a JSON object with one key 'answer', whose value is your final answer. Below are some examples:
{"answer": ["item1","item2"]}

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Local Response Normalization
## 3.3 Local Response Normalization

ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will happen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids generalization. Denoting by a i x,y the activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position ( x, y ) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity b i x,y is given by the expression

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the sum runs over n 'adjacent' kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total number of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined before training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels. The constants k, n, α , and β are hyper-parameters whose values are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2 , n = 5 , α = 10 -4 , and β = 0 75 . .

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Overall Architecture
The network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input and proceeds through layers defined by neuron counts: 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264-4096-4096-1000. It features five convolutional layers with specific kernel configurations and sizes, followed by two fully-connected layers each having 4096 neurons. GPUs communicate at certain layer stages.

Goal:
Answer the technical query by fusing the evidence from the provided context.

Query: 
Extract the input size information for the input layer of the convolutional network architecture. If the network accepts image data, the input size will be specified by its dimensions in the format 'WidthxHeightxChannels' (e.g., '64x64x1', '128x128x3', '512x512x3'). In this case, return the input dimensions as a string exactly in that format. If the network is not image-based, determine the total number of input units (neurons or nodes) and return that number as an integer. Your answer must be provided in JSON format with the key 'answer'.

Examples:
1. For an image-based network (e.g., a SVM) with input dimensions of 128x128x3:
{"answer": "128x128x3"}

2. For a network (e.g., a Generator) that takes a 100-dimensional vector as input:
{"answer": 100}

3. For a network (e.g., a Linear Regression model) with a single input feature:
{"answer": 1}

Now, for the following network:
Network: convolutional network
{"answer": "<Your Answer Here>"}Return Format:
First, provide a short explanation. Then on a new line, output a JSON object with one key 'answer', whose value is your final answer. Below are some examples:
{"answer": ["item1","item2"]}

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Local Response Normalization
## 3.3 Local Response Normalization

ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will happen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids generalization. Denoting by a i x,y the activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position ( x, y ) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity b i x,y is given by the expression

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the sum runs over n 'adjacent' kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total number of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined before training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels. The constants k, n, α , and β are hyper-parameters whose values are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2 , n = 5 , α = 10 -4 , and β = 0 75 . .

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Overall Architecture
The network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input, followed by convolutional layers with dimensions 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264, and then two fully-connected layers of 4096 neurons each, concluding with a 1000-neuron layer. GPUs communicate at specific layers. Convolutional layers use varying kernel sizes and counts; notably, the third to fifth layers are consecutively connected without normalization or pooling in between.

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Local Response Normalization
## 3.3 Local Response Normalization

ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will happen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids generalization. Denoting by a i x,y the activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position ( x, y ) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity b i x,y is given by the expression

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the sum runs over n 'adjacent' kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total number of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined before training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels. The constants k, n, α , and β are hyper-parameters whose values are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2 , n = 5 , α = 10 -4 , and β = 0 75 . .

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Overall Architecture
The network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input, followed by convolutional layers with dimensions 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264, and ends with two 4096-neuron fully-connected layers leading to a 1000-class output. GPUs communicate at specific layers. Kernels sizes vary: first layer uses 5x5 filters, others use mostly 3x3 filters without intervening pooling or normalization between the third, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers.

Okay, so I need to figure out the input size for this convolutional network based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

First, looking at the Introduction section, it mentions that the network has a 150,528-dimensional input. That's a pretty big number. But wait, is this an image-based network? The problem statement says if it's image-based, I should return the dimensions in 'WidthxHeightxChannels' format. If not, then return the total number of input units as an integer.

So, the first thing to determine is whether this network takes images as input or something else. The context refers to it as a "convolutional neural network," which typically processes image data because convolutional layers are designed for spatial data like images. So, I'm leaning towards it being image-based.

But wait, how does 150,528 relate to an image dimension? Let me think about the possible dimensions. For example, if we have a color image with three channels (RGB), and let's say the input is of size 224x224, that would be 224*224*3 = 150,528. Oh! That adds up because 224 multiplied by itself gives 50,176, times three channels gives exactly 150,528.

So, the input size is probably 224x224x3. Let me check if there's any other information in the context that might confirm this. The "Overall Architecture" section mentions that the network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input and uses convolutional layers with varying filter sizes, mostly 3x3 after the first layer which is 5x5. This aligns with typical image processing in CNNs.

I don't see any mention of non-image inputs or other types of data being fed into this network. All the context points towards it being a standard convolutional setup for images. Therefore, I can confidently say that the input dimensions are 224x224x3.
</think>

The network processes image data with an input size of 224x224 pixels and three color channels (RGB), resulting in a total dimension of 150,528.

**Answer:**  
224×224×3

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Local Response Normalization
## 3.3 Local Response Normalization

ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will happen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids generalization. Denoting by a i x,y the activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position ( x, y ) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity b i x,y is given by the expression

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the sum runs over n 'adjacent' kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total number of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined before training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels. The constants k, n, α , and β are hyper-parameters whose values are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2 , n = 5 , α = 10 -4 , and β = 0 75 . .

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Overall Architecture
The network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input, followed by convolutional layers with dimensions 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264, and ends with two 4096-neuron fully-connected layers leading to a 1000-class output. GPUs communicate at specific layers. Kernels sizes vary: first layer uses 5x5 filters, others use mostly 3x3 filters without intervening pooling or normalization between the third, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the input size for this convolutional network based on the provided context. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the query asks whether the network is image-based. If it is, we need to provide the dimensions in 'WidthxHeightxChannels' format. If not, determine the number of input units as an integer.

Looking at the context, I see that under the section "Overall Architecture," it mentions the network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input. That suggests that this is a non-image-based input because image inputs are usually specified in terms of width, height, and channels rather than just a single dimension.

Wait, but sometimes images can be represented as flattened vectors too. For example, an image of size WxHxC would have dimensions W*H*C when flattened. So maybe 150,528 is the product of these three numbers. Let me check: Could 150,528 be a common image dimension?

Well, let's see. Common image sizes include 64x64, 128x128, etc., but those are usually for smaller images. For example, 64x64x3 is 12,288 dimensions. 128x128x3 would be around 50k. 224x224x3 is about 150k, which is close to 150,528. Let me calculate: 224*224=50,176. Multiply by 3 gives 150,528. So that's exactly the number given here.

So this network takes an image input of size 224x224 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB). Therefore, it is image-based, and the input size should be specified as '224x224x3'.

Wait, but the context says "150,528-dimensional input." So that aligns with 224*224*3 = 150,528. Therefore, the network is processing images of size 224x224x3.

So to answer the query: Since it's image-based, we provide the dimensions in 'WidthxHeightxChannels' format.
</think>

The input to the convolutional network is an image with dimensions 224x224 pixels and 3 color channels (RGB). Therefore, the input size is specified as:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Input Type:** The context mentions a "150,528-dimensional input." This suggests it's a high-dimensional vector, typical of flattened image data.

2. **Determine Image Dimensions:** 
   - Calculate if 150,528 is the product of common image dimensions.
   - Find that 224x224x3 equals 150,528 (since 224*224=50,176; 50,176*3=150,528).

3. **Conclude Input Size:** The input is an image of size 224x224 pixels with 3 channels.

**Answer:**

The convolutional network has an input size of '224x224x3'. 

\boxed{224 \times 224 \times 3}

Okay, so I need to figure out the input size for this convolutional network based on the provided context. Let's go through it step by step.

First, looking at the examples given, if it's image-based, the answer should be in 'WidthxHeightxChannels' format. Otherwise, return the number of input units as an integer. The network here is a convolutional network, so I think it's likely processing images, but I need to confirm from the context.

Looking at the context dump, under "Overall Architecture," it says: "The network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input..." That seems like a vector input rather than an image. But wait, maybe that's the flattened version of an image? Let me check if there's any mention of image dimensions.

In the context, I don't see any specific mention of image width and height. The first layer uses 5x5 filters, which is common for images, but without knowing the input size, it's hard to tell. However, since the input is described as 150,528-dimensional, that suggests each sample is a vector with 150,528 features.

If this were an image, we'd expect something like WxHxC. For example, if the input was 224x224x3 (common in CNNs), that would be 224*224*3=150,528. Wait, 224 times 224 is 50,176 multiplied by 3 channels gives exactly 150,528. So perhaps the input size is 224x224x3.

But in the context, it's mentioned as a 150,528-dimensional input, not specifying width and height. However, given that it's a convolutional network, it's common to have image inputs with such dimensions. So maybe I can assume it's an image input of size 224x224x3.

Wait, but the problem says if the network is image-based, return the WxHxC format; else, the number of units. Since this is a convolutional network, which typically processes images, and given that the input dimension matches 224x224x3, it's reasonable to conclude that the input size is 224x224x3.

Alternatively, if I'm unsure, perhaps I should consider whether the context gives any hints about image sizes. The first layer uses 5x5 filters, which suggests that the input might be larger than that, but without more info, it's hard to tell exactly. However, given that the total input dimension is 150k and assuming RGB (3 channels), 224x224 makes sense because many standard CNNs use this size.

So putting it all together, I think the input size is 224x224x3.
</think>

The convolutional network processes an image input with dimensions 224x224 pixels and 3 color channels (RGB). This results in a total of 150,528 features (224 * 224 * 3), which matches the described input size.

**Answer:**  
The input size is \boxed{224 \times 224 \times 3}.

In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) .

We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Overall Architecture
The GPUs communicate only at certain layers. The network's input is 150,528-dimensional, and the number of neurons in the network's remaining layers is given by 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,2644096-4096-1000. <!-- image -->

neurons in a kernel map). The second convolutional layer takes as input the (response-normalized and pooled) output of the first convolutional layer and filters it with 256 kernels of size 5 × 5 × 48 . The third, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected to one another without any intervening pooling or normalization layers. The third convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 256 connected to the (normalized, pooled) outputs of the second convolutional layer. The fourth convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192 , and the fifth convolutional layer has 256 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192 . The fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each.

### Dropout
It is, therefore, forced to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. At test time, we use all the neurons but multiply their outputs by 0.5, which is a reasonable approximation to taking the geometric mean of the predictive distributions produced by the exponentially-many dropout networks. We use dropout in the first two fully-connected layers of Figure 2. Without dropout, our network exhibits substantial overfitting. Dropout roughly doubles the number of iterations required to converge.

### Overlapping Pooling
## 3.4 Overlapping Pooling

Pooling layers in CNNs summarize the outputs of neighboring groups of neurons in the same kernel map. Traditionally, the neighborhoods summarized by adjacent pooling units do not overlap (e.g., [17, 11, 4]). To be more precise, a pooling layer can be thought of as consisting of a grid of pooling units spaced s pixels apart, each summarizing a neighborhood of size z × z centered at the location of the pooling unit. If we set s = z , we obtain traditional local pooling as commonly employed in CNNs.

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### The Architecture
## 3 The Architecture

The architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers five convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual features of our network's architecture.

### Qualitative Evaluations
The network's two data-connected layers learned frequency- and orientation-selective kernels with color specialization across GPUs: GPU 1 is color-agnostic, while GPU 2 is color-specific. Figure 4 demonstrates top-5 predictions on test images from ILSVRC-2010, showing accurate object recognition even for off-center objects. Additionally, the network's feature vectors reveal similar higher-level visual features between diverse pose images of the same class, despite pixel-level differences.

Okay, so I need to find out how many units are in the output layer of the convolutional network described in the context. The user is asking for this number as an integer inside a JSON object with the key 'answer'. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, looking at the sections provided. There's a section titled "Overall Architecture" that mentions the network's input and layers. It says: "The network's input is 150,528-dimensional, and the number of neurons in the network's remaining layers is given by 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,2644096-4096-1000." Hmm, that looks like a list of neurons in each layer after the input.

Wait, let me parse this. The input is 150,528-dimensional. Then the next layers have the number of neurons as 253,440; then 186,624; followed by two layers with 64,896 each; another layer with 43,264; and then two fully-connected layers with 4096 each. Finally, it ends with 1000.

So the sequence is: 253,440 → 186,624 → 64,896 ×2 → 43,264 → 4096 ×2 → 1000. So the last number here is 1000.

Wait a second, I think that might be a typo in the original context because the numbers are written without spaces: "43,2644096-4096-1000". Maybe it's supposed to be 43,264; then 4096, 4096, and 1000. That would make sense because often in CNNs, after convolutional layers, you have fully connected layers leading up to the output.

So the output layer is 1000 units, which are neurons or nodes. Therefore, the answer should be 1000.

### Overall Architecture
## 3.5 Overall Architecture

Now we are ready to describe the overall architecture of our CNN. As depicted in Figure 2, the net contains eight layers with weights; the first five are convolutional and the remaining three are fullyconnected. The output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax which produces a distribution over the 1000 class labels. Our network maximizes the multinomial logistic regression objective, which is equivalent to maximizing the average across training cases of the log-probability of the correct label under the prediction distribution. The kernels of the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected only to those kernel maps in the previous layer which reside on the same GPU (see Figure 2). The kernels of the third convolutional layer are connected to all kernel maps in the second layer. The neurons in the fullyconnected layers are connected to all neurons in the previous layer. Response-normalization layers follow the first and second convolutional layers. Max-pooling layers, of the kind described in Section 3.4, follow both response-normalization layers as well as the fifth convolutional layer. The ReLU non-linearity is applied to the output of every convolutional and fully-connected layer. The first convolutional layer filters the 224 × 224 × 3 input image with 96 kernels of size 11 × 11 × 3 with a stride of 4 pixels (this is the distance between the receptive field centers of neighboring

### The Architecture
## 3 The Architecture

The architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers five convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual features of our network's architecture.

### Introduction
## 1 Introduction

Current approaches to object recognition make essential use of machine learning methods. To improve their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use better techniques for preventing overfitting. Until recently, datasets of labeled images were relatively small - on the order of tens of thousands of images (e.g., NORB [16], Caltech-101/256 [8, 9], and CIFAR-10/100 [12]). Simple recognition tasks can be solved quite well with datasets of this size, especially if they are augmented with label-preserving transformations. For example, the currentbest error rate on the MNIST digit-recognition task (&lt;0.3%) approaches human performance [4]. But objects in realistic settings exhibit considerable variability, so to learn to recognize them it is necessary to use much larger training sets. And indeed, the shortcomings of small image datasets have been widely recognized (e.g., Pinto et al.

### Details of learning
Weight decay in this context not only regularizes but also reduces the model's training error. The weight update rule incorporates momentum and a learning rate, adjusting weights based on batch-averaged derivatives of the objective function. Weights are initialized from a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation 0.01, while biases are set to 1 or 0 depending on the layer, optimizing early learning stages for ReLU activation functions. The network uses an adjustable equal learning rate across layers; initially set at 0.01, it was reduced three times over the course of training. Training involved approximately 90 passes through a dataset of 1.2 million images and took five to six days using two NVIDIA GTX 580 3GB GPUs.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many instances of each core layer type are in this convolutional network architecture. The user wants me to count only essential layers like convolutional, fully connected, and attention layers. I should ignore noise layers, activation functions, modification layers, and pooling layers.

Looking at the context provided, I see a section called "Overall Architecture" which mentions that the network has eight layers with weights. Specifically, it says there are five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers. 

I need to check if there are any attention or other core layers mentioned. Scanning through the context, I don't see any mention of attention layers or transformer encoders. The architecture details focus on convolutional and fully connected layers.

So, compiling this information: Convolutional has 5 instances, Fully Connected has 3. There's no mention of attention layers, so their count would be zero. However, since the examples provided only include layers that are present, I might not need to include attention in the output unless specified. But looking at the examples, they included all mentioned types even if some were zero. Wait, no, the examples included only the ones present. So perhaps I should include only convolutional and fully connected here.

Wait, but the second example shows that when a layer is not present, it's not included in the output. For instance, in the first example, Recurrent layers are counted because they were mentioned. In our case, there are no attention or other core layers, so we should only include Convolutional and Fully Connected.

Therefore, the JSON output should have "Convolutional":5 and "Fully Connected":3.
</think>

The network architecture consists of 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully-connected layers. No attention layers were mentioned in the context.

### The Architecture
## 3 The Architecture

The architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers five convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual features of our network's architecture.

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Overall Architecture
## 3.5 Overall Architecture

Now we are ready to describe the overall architecture of our CNN. As depicted in Figure 2, the net contains eight layers with weights; the first five are convolutional and the remaining three are fullyconnected. The output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax which produces a distribution over the 1000 class labels.

where i is the iteration index, v is the momentum variable, glyph[epsilon1] is the learning rate, and 〈 ∂L ∂w w ∣ ∣ i 〉 D i is the average over the i th batch D i of the derivative of the objective with respect to w , evaluated at w i . We initialized the weights in each layer from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation 0.01. We initialized the neuron biases in the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers, as well as in the fully-connected hidden layers, with the constant 1. This initialization accelerates the early stages of learning by providing the ReLUs with positive inputs. We initialized the neuron biases in the remaining layers with the constant 0. We used an equal learning rate for all layers, which we adjusted manually throughout training. The heuristic which we followed was to divide the learning rate by 10 when the validation error rate stopped improving with the current learning rate. The learning rate was initialized at 0.01 and

reduced three times prior to termination. We trained the network for roughly 90 cycles through the training set of 1.2 million images, which took five to six days on two NVIDIA GTX 580 3GB GPUs.

### Discussion
Deep CNN achieves record-breaking results on a challenging dataset; slight architecture changes, like removing layers, notably degrade performance.

Okay, I need to determine whether the convolutional network architecture mentioned in the context includes any noise layers such as Dropout, Gaussian Noise, or Batch Normalization. 

Looking through the provided context, under "Details of learning," it mentions that the weights were initialized with a zero-mean Gaussian distribution and biases were set to specific constants. However, there's no mention of dropout or other noise layers being part of the architecture.

In the "Overall Architecture" section, it describes response-normalization layers and max-pooling layers, but these are different from noise layers like Dropout or Batch Normalization. The ReLU nonlinearity is used, but that doesn't add noise either.

The context doesn't provide any information about introducing randomness or noise into the network layers. Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the convolutional network does not include any noise layers.

### Discussion
## 7 Discussion

Our results show that a large, deep convolutional neural network is capable of achieving recordbreaking results on a highly challenging dataset using purely supervised learning. It is notable that our network's performance degrades if a single convolutional layer is removed. For example, removing any of the middle layers results in a loss of about 2% for the top-1 performance of the network. So the depth really is important for achieving our results.

### Introduction
[21]), but it has only recently become possible to collect labeled datasets with millions of images. The new larger datasets include LabelMe [23], which consists of hundreds of thousands of fully-segmented images, and ImageNet [6], which consists of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories. To learn about thousands of objects from millions of images, we need a model with a large learning capacity. However, the immense complexity of the object recognition task means that this problem cannot be specified even by a dataset as large as ImageNet, so our model should also have lots of prior knowledge to compensate for all the data we don't have. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) constitute one such class of models [16, 11, 13, 18, 15, 22, 26]. Their capacity can be controlled by varying their depth and breadth, and they also make strong and mostly correct assumptions about the nature of images (namely, stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies). Thus, compared to standard feedforward neural networks with similarly-sized layers, CNNs have much fewer connections and parameters and so they are easier to train, while their theoretically-best performance is likely to be only slightly worse. Despite the attractive qualities of CNNs, and despite the relative efficiency of their local architecture, they have still been prohibitively expensive to apply in large scale to high-resolution images. Luckily, current GPUs, paired with a highly-optimized implementation of 2D convolution, are powerful enough to facilitate the training of interestingly-large CNNs, and recent datasets such as ImageNet contain enough labeled examples to train such models without severe overfitting. The specific contributions of this paper are as follows: we trained one of the largest convolutional neural networks to date on the subsets of ImageNet used in the ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012 competitions [2] and achieved by far the best results ever reported on these datasets. We wrote a highly-optimized GPU implementation of 2D convolution and all the other operations inherent in training convolutional neural networks, which we make available publicly .

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation helps reduce overfitting by artificially increasing dataset size through transformations. Two types are utilized: generating translations and horizontal reflections of images, and altering RGB channel intensities. For the first type, 224x224 patches (and their reflections) from 256x256 images are extracted during training to expand the dataset by a factor of about 2048, though with high interdependence among examples. At test time, predictions average results from ten patches—five locations and their horizontal reflections. For the second type, PCA is applied to ImageNet's RGB pixel values; then, principal components are added to each training image using magnitudes proportional to eigenvalues and a random variable drawn from a Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation of 0.1, enhancing data variability without storing transformed images.

First, looking at the Discussion section: It mentions that their network achieved record-breaking results using purely supervised learning. Supervised learning typically uses loss functions like cross-entropy for classification tasks, but it doesn't specify which one exactly. So maybe they used Categorical Cross Entropy?

In the Introduction, there's a lot about CNNs and datasets but no mention of specific loss functions. It talks about model capacity and optimization but not the loss.

The Training on Multiple GPUs section discusses how they spread the network across two GPUs for parallel processing. Again, nothing about loss functions here.

Data Augmentation is another part, talking about techniques to reduce overfitting by expanding the dataset through transformations and reflections. Still no info on loss functions.

Wait, maybe I missed something? Let me check again. The examples given in the query include Categorical Cross Entropy, Binary Cross Entropy, MSE. Since it's a classification task (as mentioned in the Discussion), Categorical Cross Entropy is likely used. But does the context explicitly mention this?

Looking back: The Introduction mentions "supervised learning" but doesn't specify. The Discussion says they achieved good results with supervised learning but no loss function names are given.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since it's a convolutional network for image classification (as ImageNet is used), the most common loss would be Categorical Cross Entropy. But without explicit mention in the context, can I assume that?

Alternatively, maybe they used another loss. But looking at the context again: No specific loss functions are mentioned anywhere. The closest is in the Training section where they talk about cross-entropy for data augmentation? Wait, no—that's about transforming data, not the loss function.

Wait, perhaps it's implied because they mention supervised learning and classification tasks typically use CCE. But I'm supposed to only use the provided context. Since the context doesn't explicitly state any loss functions, maybe there are none mentioned here.

So, after checking all sections again, I don't see any explicit mention of loss functions used in their network's architecture. Therefore, the answer would be an empty list.
</think>

The context does not explicitly mention any specific loss functions used for the convolutional network's architecture.

### Introduction
[21]), but it has only recently become possible to collect labeled datasets with millions of images. The new larger datasets include LabelMe [23], which consists of hundreds of thousands of fully-segmented images, and ImageNet [6], which consists of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories. To learn about thousands of objects from millions of images, we need a model with a large learning capacity. However, the immense complexity of the object recognition task means that this problem cannot be specified even by a dataset as large as ImageNet, so our model should also have lots of prior knowledge to compensate for all the data we don't have. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) constitute one such class of models [16, 11, 13, 18, 15, 22, 26]. Their capacity can be controlled by varying their depth and breadth, and they also make strong and mostly correct assumptions about the nature of images (namely, stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies). Thus, compared to standard feedforward neural networks with similarly-sized layers, CNNs have much fewer connections and parameters and so they are easier to train, while their theoretically-best performance is likely to be only slightly worse. Despite the attractive qualities of CNNs, and despite the relative efficiency of their local architecture, they have still been prohibitively expensive to apply in large scale to high-resolution images. Luckily, current GPUs, paired with a highly-optimized implementation of 2D convolution, are powerful enough to facilitate the training of interestingly-large CNNs, and recent datasets such as ImageNet contain enough labeled examples to train such models without severe overfitting. The specific contributions of this paper are as follows: we trained one of the largest convolutional neural networks to date on the subsets of ImageNet used in the ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012 competitions [2] and achieved by far the best results ever reported on these datasets. We wrote a highly-optimized GPU implementation of 2D convolution and all the other operations inherent in training convolutional neural networks, which we make available publicly .

### Data Augmentation
## 4.1 Data Augmentation

The easiest and most common method to reduce overfitting on image data is to artificially enlarge the dataset using label-preserving transformations (e.g., [25, 4, 5]). We employ two distinct forms of data augmentation, both of which allow transformed images to be produced from the original images with very little computation, so the transformed images do not need to be stored on disk. In our implementation, the transformed images are generated in Python code on the CPU while the GPU is training on the previous batch of images. So these data augmentation schemes are, in effect, computationally free. The first form of data augmentation consists of generating image translations and horizontal reflections. We do this by extracting random 224 × 224 patches (and their horizontal reflections) from the 256 × 256 images and training our network on these extracted patches . This increases the size of our 4 training set by a factor of 2048, though the resulting training examples are, of course, highly interdependent. Without this scheme, our network suffers from substantial overfitting, which would have forced us to use much smaller networks. At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting five 224 × 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network's softmax layer on the ten patches. The second form of data augmentation consists of altering the intensities of the RGB channels in training images. Specifically, we perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the ImageNet training set. To each training image, we add multiples of the found principal components,

with magnitudes proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues times a random variable drawn from a Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. Therefore to each RGB image pixel I xy = [ I R xy , I G xy , I B T xy ] we add the following quantity:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where p i and λ i are i th eigenvector and eigenvalue of the 3 × 3 covariance matrix of RGB pixel values, respectively, and α i is the aforementioned random variable. Each α i is drawn only once for all the pixels of a particular training image until that image is used for training again, at which point it is re-drawn.

### Discussion
In experiments, we avoided unsupervised pre-training due to computational constraints but acknowledge its potential benefits with more resources. Results improved by increasing network size and training duration, though significant advancements are needed to match human visual processing. Our goal is to utilize large convolutional nets on video sequences to leverage temporal information absent in static images.

Alright, so I need to figure out the primary task that a convolutional network (CNN) architecture is designed to perform based on the provided context. Let me go through this step by step.

First, looking at the introduction section, it mentions that CNNs are used for object recognition tasks. They were trained on subsets of ImageNet for competitions like ILSVRC-2010 and 2012. The main goal here is to classify images into predefined categories. This suggests a classification task.

Next, in the data augmentation section, they talk about techniques that help reduce overfitting by artificially increasing the dataset size. Techniques include image translations, reflections, and altering RGB intensities. These methods are common in training models for supervised tasks where labeled data is used to improve generalization.

In the discussion, it's noted that unsupervised pre-training was avoided due to computational constraints but its benefits were acknowledged. This implies that while they considered other approaches, their primary method was supervised learning.

Looking at the task types provided: Supervised Classification involves assigning inputs to predefined categories using fully labeled data. The examples given include CNNs trained on medical images for disease classification, which aligns with what's described in the context about ImageNet and object recognition.

Other tasks like Generation (like GANs) or Discrimination don't fit as the focus here is clearly on classifying images, not generating them or distinguishing between distributions. Reconstruction and Regression aren't mentioned either. The paper doesn't discuss clustering or unsupervised methods beyond a brief mention of avoiding pre-training.

So putting it all together, the primary task for this CNN architecture is Supervised Classification.
</think>

The convolutional network architecture described in the provided context was primarily designed for **supervised classification** tasks. This conclusion is based on several key points from the context:

1. **Object Recognition Focus**: The introduction emphasizes training a large CNN on subsets of ImageNet (ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012) with the goal of achieving high accuracy in object recognition, which is a classic supervised classification task.

2. **Data Augmentation Techniques**: The discussion of data augmentation methods, such as image translations, reflections, and RGB intensity alterations, highlights efforts to improve model performance on labeled datasets. These techniques are commonly used in supervised learning to enhance generalization without the need for additional labels.

3. **Avoidance of Unsupervised Pre-training**: While acknowledging the potential benefits of unsupervised pre-training, the authors opted against it due to computational constraints. This suggests that their primary approach was supervised learning, leveraging fully labeled data.

4. **Task Types Alignment**: Among the provided task types, Supervised Classification aligns with the context's focus on assigning images to predefined categories using labeled datasets, such as in medical image analysis examples.

In summary, the architecture is centered around supervised classification, aiming to accurately categorize input images into specific classes using fully labeled training data.

Okay, I need to determine the primary task that a convolutional network (CNN) is designed to perform based on the provided context. The options include tasks like Supervised Classification, Generation, Discrimination, etc.

The context also discusses data augmentation techniques used to prevent overfitting, which is common in supervised settings where you have a large amount of labeled training data. Additionally, the network's performance improvements come from increasing size and training duration, typical for models in classification tasks.

There’s no mention of generative tasks like creating images (which would be Generation) or distinguishing between real and fake data (Discrimination). The focus is clearly on categorizing inputs into specific classes using labeled data. Therefore, the primary task here is Supervised Classification.

The convolutional network's primary task is to perform supervised classification by assigning input images to predefined categories using large labeled datasets like ImageNet.

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Local Response Normalization
## 3.3 Local Response Normalization

ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will happen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids generalization. Denoting by a i x,y the activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position ( x, y ) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity b i x,y is given by the expression

where the sum runs over n 'adjacent' kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total number of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined before training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels. The constants k, n, α , and β are hyper-parameters whose values are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2 , n = 5 , α = 10 -4 , and β = 0 75 . .

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Overall Architecture
GPUs communicate at specific layers in a network with an input dimension of 150,528 and subsequent neuron counts: 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264-4096-4096-1000. Convolutional layers use different kernel sizes and counts, with the fully-connected layers having 4096 neurons each.

Okay, I need to extract the input size information for the convolutional network architecture described in the context. The query specifies that if it's an image-based network, the input should be in 'WidthxHeightxChannels' format. Otherwise, if not image-based, return the number of input units as an integer.

Looking through the provided context, I see a section titled "Overall Architecture" which mentions the network has an input dimension of 150,528. The subsequent layers have neuron counts listed: 253,440-186,624, etc., down to 1000. 

Since this is a convolutional network and the context doesn't mention image dimensions or channels explicitly, it suggests that the input isn't specified in terms of width, height, and channels. Instead, the input is given as a single number, 150,528. This implies that the network might be taking a flattened vector as input rather than an image.

Therefore, since the network isn't described with image dimensions but has an input size of 150,528 units, the answer should be this integer value.
</think>

The network's input is specified as a single dimension of 150,528 units. Since it's not described using image dimensions (WidthxHeightxChannels), we provide the total number of input units.
