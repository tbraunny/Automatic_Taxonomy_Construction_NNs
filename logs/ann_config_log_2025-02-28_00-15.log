### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Local Response Normalization
## 3.3 Local Response Normalization

ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will happen in that neuron. However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids generalization. Denoting by a i x,y the activity of a neuron computed by applying kernel i at position ( x, y ) and then applying the ReLU nonlinearity, the response-normalized activity b i x,y is given by the expression

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the sum runs over n 'adjacent' kernel maps at the same spatial position, and N is the total number of kernels in the layer. The ordering of the kernel maps is of course arbitrary and determined before training begins. This sort of response normalization implements a form of lateral inhibition inspired by the type found in real neurons, creating competition for big activities amongst neuron outputs computed using different kernels. The constants k, n, α , and β are hyper-parameters whose values are determined using a validation set; we used k = 2 , n = 5 , α = 10 -4 , and β = 0 75 . .

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Overall Architecture
The network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input and progresses through layers of 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264-4096-4096 neurons, ending with 1000. It includes five convolutional layers; the second uses 256 kernels of size 5×5×48, while the third to fifth use 384, 384, and 256 kernels respectively, all of size 3×3×X. Fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each. GPUs communicate only at certain points in this structure.

Okay, I need to extract the input size information for the convolutional network described in the context. The query specifies that if it's image-based, return the dimensions as 'WidthxHeightxChannels', otherwise give the number of input units.

Looking through the context:

In the "Overall Architecture" section, it mentions the network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input. That suggests the input isn't an image but rather a high-dimensional vector. So I should find out how many neurons or nodes are in the input layer.

Wait, 150,528 dimensions—what does that mean? Since it's a convolutional network, usually images have dimensions like Width x Height x Channels. But if the input is given as a single number, 150,528, maybe it's flattened or not an image.

Wait another thought: 150,528 might be calculated from some image dimensions. Let me check if that makes sense. For example, a common image size like 224x224 has 224*224=50,176 pixels. If it's RGB (3 channels), then 50k *3 = 150,528. Oh, that adds up! So the input could be an image with dimensions 224x224x3.

But wait, the context says "the network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input". Does that mean it's flattened into a single vector? Or is it structured as an image tensor?

In convolutional networks, inputs are typically given in the format of Width x Height x Channels. So if it's 224x224 RGB, that would be 150,528 elements when multiplied together (224*224*3=150,528). 

So should I represent this as "224x224x3" or just take the total number of input units as 150,528?

The query says to return the dimensions if it's image-based. So since the network is convolutional and starts with that structure, it's likely processing images. Therefore, the input size should be given as "WidthxHeightxChannels".

Wait, but in the context, under "Overall Architecture", it just states 150,528-dimensional input without specifying the dimensions. So maybe I can't assume it's 224x224x3; perhaps the input is a flattened vector of that size, making it not an image-based input but a high-dimensional one.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The context doesn't explicitly state whether the input is in image format or a flattened vector. However, since it's a convolutional network, which typically works with image data, it's more likely that 150,528 represents an image tensor.

Calculating: 224*224=50,176; multiplied by 3 channels gives 150,528. So the input is probably a 224x224 RGB image.

Alternatively, if it's not an image but a flattened vector of 150k dimensions, that would be unusual for a CNN, which typically takes tensor inputs. So I think it's safe to assume the input size is 224x224x3.
</think>

The input size for the convolutional network is determined to be an image with dimensions **224x224x3** (width x height x channels). This calculation comes from recognizing that a common image size of 224x224 pixels, when multiplied by 3 channels (for RGB), results in a total of 150,528 elements. Therefore, the network starts with an input layer structured as an image tensor rather than a flattened vector.

**Answer:** The input size is **224x224x3**.

So the answer should be {"answer": 150528}.

I don't see any other relevant information in the context that would suggest a different interpretation. The initial part talks about ReLUs and normalization but doesn't mention image sizes. So I'm confident that the input size is 150,528 units.

The network has an input layer with 150,528 dimensions, as stated in the context.

Okay, so I need to figure out the input size for a convolutional network based on the provided context. The user wants either the dimensions if it's image-based or the number of input units otherwise.

Looking through the context, I see that the network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input. That seems like a lot, so maybe it's not an image? Because images are usually in the format width x height x channels.

Wait, let me think again. The context mentions "the network starts with a 150,528-dimensional input." That suggests it's taking a vector of that size as input, which might imply it's not image-based but perhaps some other data type. If it were an image, the dimensions would probably be specified in terms like widthxheightxchannels.

Also, the network has five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers. The first layer after the input is 253,440 neurons, which is quite a jump from 150k to over 250k. That might indicate that it's processing a large vector rather than images.

Since there's no mention of image dimensions like width and height in the context, I think this network isn't handling images but instead takes a high-dimensional input vector. Therefore, the input size is just the number of units, which is 150,528.
</think>

The convolutional network begins with an input layer that has a dimensionality of 150,528. The context does not mention image dimensions (width x height x channels), indicating this is not an image-based model.

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Overall Architecture
The GPUs communicate only at certain layers. The network's input is 150,528-dimensional, and the number of neurons in the network's remaining layers is given by 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,2644096-4096-1000. <!-- image -->

neurons in a kernel map). The second convolutional layer takes as input the (response-normalized and pooled) output of the first convolutional layer and filters it with 256 kernels of size 5 × 5 × 48 . The third, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected to one another without any intervening pooling or normalization layers. The third convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 256 connected to the (normalized, pooled) outputs of the second convolutional layer. The fourth convolutional layer has 384 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192 , and the fifth convolutional layer has 256 kernels of size 3 × 3 × 192 . The fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each.

### Dropout
It is, therefore, forced to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. At test time, we use all the neurons but multiply their outputs by 0.5, which is a reasonable approximation to taking the geometric mean of the predictive distributions produced by the exponentially-many dropout networks. We use dropout in the first two fully-connected layers of Figure 2. Without dropout, our network exhibits substantial overfitting. Dropout roughly doubles the number of iterations required to converge.

### Overlapping Pooling
## 3.4 Overlapping Pooling

Pooling layers in CNNs summarize the outputs of neighboring groups of neurons in the same kernel map. Traditionally, the neighborhoods summarized by adjacent pooling units do not overlap (e.g., [17, 11, 4]). To be more precise, a pooling layer can be thought of as consisting of a grid of pooling units spaced s pixels apart, each summarizing a neighborhood of size z × z centered at the location of the pooling unit. If we set s = z , we obtain traditional local pooling as commonly employed in CNNs.

### Introduction
1 Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. The size of our network made overfitting a significant problem, even with 1.2 million labeled training examples, so we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. Our final network contains five convolutional and three fully-connected layers, and this depth seems to be important: we found that removing any convolutional layer (each of which contains no more than 1% of the model's parameters) resulted in inferior performance. In the end, the network's size is limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs and by the amount of training time that we are willing to tolerate. Our network takes between five and six days to train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs. All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.

### The Architecture
## 3 The Architecture

The architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers five convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual features of our network's architecture.

### Qualitative Evaluations
The text discusses qualitative evaluations of a neural network's performance. Convolutional kernels learned by two data-connected layers show specialization for color-agnostic (GPU 1) and color-specific (GPU 2) features. Figure 4 illustrates the model’s top-5 predictions on test images from ILSVRC-2010, demonstrating its ability to recognize objects even when off-center. Additionally, it explores similarity between images based on feature vector distances in the last hidden layer, showing that similar semantic content can be recognized regardless of pixel-level differences like pose variations.

Okay, so I need to figure out the number of units in the output layer of a convolutional network architecture based on the provided context. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should look through the context for any mentions of layers, specifically the output layer. The context talks about different parts of the network, including convolutional layers and fully-connected layers.

Looking at the section titled "Overall Architecture," it says: "The network's input is 150,528-dimensional, and the number of neurons in the network's remaining layers is given by 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264-4096-4096-1000." Hmm, that looks like a list of the number of neurons in each subsequent layer. Let me parse this correctly.

So starting from the input layer (which has 150,528 dimensions), the next layers have 253,440, then 186,624, followed by two layers with 64,896 each, then 43,264, and after that, two layers of 4096 each. The last number is 1000.

Wait, does this mean the output layer has 1000 neurons? That makes sense because in many convolutional networks, especially those used for image classification tasks like CIFAR-10 or ILSVRC, the output layer corresponds to the number of classes. For example, if there are 1000 classes, the output layer would have 1000 units.

Let me check other sections to confirm. In the "The Architecture" section, it mentions that the network contains eight learned layers: five convolutional and three fully-connected. The last part of the overall architecture list ends with 4096-4096-1000, which are two fully-connected layers followed by the output layer.

Another point is in the "Introduction" section, where it's mentioned that the network uses techniques to prevent overfitting and has a certain structure. The last hidden layer before the output might be one of the 4096 neuron layers, leading into the final output.

So putting this all together, the output layer should have 1000 units because that's the last number in the sequence provided in the "Overall Architecture" section.
</think>

The convolutional network's architecture lists the number of neurons in each layer as 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264-4096-4096-1000. The final number, 1000, represents the output layer.

Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking for the number of units in the output layer of a convolutional network architecture and wants it returned as an integer in JSON format with the key 'answer'. 

First, I'll look through the provided context to find where the architecture details are mentioned. Scanning through the sections, the "Overall Architecture" part stands out. It mentions that the input is 150,528-dimensional and then lists the number of neurons in subsequent layers as 253,440-186,624-64,896-64,896-43,264-4096-4096-1000. 

This sequence represents the number of neurons in each layer starting from the input. So, the last number in this list should be the output layer. Looking at it, the numbers go down to 1000. That makes sense because a common setup in classification tasks is to have an output layer matching the number of classes. Since ILSVRC-2010 typically has 1000 classes, this aligns with that.

I should double-check if there's any other part of the context that might mention the output layer differently, but from what I see, this is the only place specifying the layers in order. Therefore, the output layer has 1000 units.
</think>

The output layer of the convolutional network architecture has **1000** neurons, as indicated by the sequence of neuron counts provided in the context.

### Overall Architecture
## 3.5 Overall Architecture

Now we are ready to describe the overall architecture of our CNN. As depicted in Figure 2, the net contains eight layers with weights; the first five are convolutional and the remaining three are fullyconnected. The output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax which produces a distribution over the 1000 class labels. Our network maximizes the multinomial logistic regression objective, which is equivalent to maximizing the average across training cases of the log-probability of the correct label under the prediction distribution. The kernels of the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected only to those kernel maps in the previous layer which reside on the same GPU (see Figure 2). The kernels of the third convolutional layer are connected to all kernel maps in the second layer. The neurons in the fullyconnected layers are connected to all neurons in the previous layer. Response-normalization layers follow the first and second convolutional layers. Max-pooling layers, of the kind described in Section 3.4, follow both response-normalization layers as well as the fifth convolutional layer. The ReLU non-linearity is applied to the output of every convolutional and fully-connected layer. The first convolutional layer filters the 224 × 224 × 3 input image with 96 kernels of size 11 × 11 × 3 with a stride of 4 pixels (this is the distance between the receptive field centers of neighboring

## 3 The Architecture

The architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers five convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual features of our network's architecture.

### Introduction
## 1 Introduction

Current approaches to object recognition make essential use of machine learning methods. To improve their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use better techniques for preventing overfitting. Until recently, datasets of labeled images were relatively small - on the order of tens of thousands of images (e.g., NORB [16], Caltech-101/256 [8, 9], and CIFAR-10/100 [12]). Simple recognition tasks can be solved quite well with datasets of this size, especially if they are augmented with label-preserving transformations. For example, the currentbest error rate on the MNIST digit-recognition task (&lt;0.3%) approaches human performance [4]. But objects in realistic settings exhibit considerable variability, so to learn to recognize them it is necessary to use much larger training sets. And indeed, the shortcomings of small image datasets have been widely recognized (e.g., Pinto et al.

### Details of learning
Weight decay in this context not only acts as a regularizer but also reduces the model's training error. The weight update rule involves iteration index \(i\), momentum variable \(v\), learning rate \(\eta\), and the average derivative of the objective with respect to weights \(w\) over batch \(D_i\). Weights were initialized from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01, while biases in specific layers were set to 1 or 0, aiding ReLU activations early on. An equal learning rate was used across all layers and adjusted manually; if validation error stagnated, the rate was divided by ten. Starting at 0.01, the rate was reduced thrice before training ended after approximately 90 epochs over a dataset of 1.2 million images, taking five to six days on two NVIDIA GTX 580 GPUs.

Alright, so I need to figure out how to extract the number of instances for each core layer type in a convolutional network architecture based on the provided context. The user has specified that I should only count layers like convolutional, fully connected (dense), and attention layers. Other layers such as noise, activation functions, modifications, or pooling layers shouldn't be counted.

Looking at the context dump, there are sections about the overall architecture of a CNN. In section 3.5, it mentions that the network has eight layers with weights. The first five are convolutional layers, and the remaining three are fully connected. So from this, I can note down:

- Convolutional: 5
- Fully Connected: 3

I should check if there's any mention of attention layers or other core types mentioned in the context. Scanning through the rest of the sections like Results, The Architecture (section 3), Introduction, and Details of learning, I don't see any reference to attention layers or transformer encoders being used. Therefore, their counts would be zero.

I also need to ensure that I'm not including any activation functions like ReLU, pooling layers such as max-pooling, or normalization layers which are mentioned but shouldn't be counted according to the query's instructions.

### The Architecture
## 3 The Architecture

The architecture of our network is summarized in Figure 2. It contains eight learned layers five convolutional and three fully-connected. Below, we describe some of the novel or unusual features of our network's architecture.

### ReLU Nonlinearity
## 3.1 ReLU Nonlinearity

The standard way to model a neuron's output f as a function of its input x is with f ( x ) = tanh( x ) or f ( x ) = (1 + e -x ) -1 . In terms of training time with gradient descent, these saturating nonlinearities are much slower than the non-saturating nonlinearity f ( x ) = max(0 , x ) . Following Nair and Hinton [20], we refer to neurons with this nonlinearity as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which shows the number of iterations required to reach 25% training error on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a particular four-layer convolutional network. This plot shows that we would not have been able to experiment with such large neural networks for this work if we had used traditional saturating neuron models. We are not the first to consider alternatives to traditional neuron models in CNNs.

### Overall Architecture
## 3.5 Overall Architecture

Now we are ready to describe the overall architecture of our CNN. As depicted in Figure 2, the net contains eight layers with weights; the first five are convolutional and the remaining three are fullyconnected. The output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax which produces a distribution over the 1000 class labels. Our network maximizes the multinomial logistic regression objective, which is equivalent to maximizing the average across training cases of the log-probability of the correct label under the prediction distribution. The kernels of the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers are connected only to those kernel maps in the previous layer which reside on the same GPU (see Figure 2). The kernels of the third convolutional layer are connected to all kernel maps in the second layer. The neurons in the fullyconnected layers are connected to all neurons in the previous layer. Response-normalization layers follow the first and second convolutional layers. Max-pooling layers, of the kind described in Section 3.4, follow both response-normalization layers as well as the fifth convolutional layer. The ReLU non-linearity is applied to the output of every convolutional and fully-connected layer. The first convolutional layer filters the 224 × 224 × 3 input image with 96 kernels of size 11 × 11 × 3 with a stride of 4 pixels (this is the distance between the receptive field centers of neighboring

### Details of learning
In other words, weight decay here is not merely a regularizer: it reduces the model's training error. The update rule for weight w was

where i is the iteration index, v is the momentum variable, glyph[epsilon1] is the learning rate, and 〈 ∂L ∂w w ∣ ∣ i 〉 D i is the average over the i th batch D i of the derivative of the objective with respect to w , evaluated at w i . We initialized the weights in each layer from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation 0.01. We initialized the neuron biases in the second, fourth, and fifth convolutional layers, as well as in the fully-connected hidden layers, with the constant 1. This initialization accelerates the early stages of learning by providing the ReLUs with positive inputs. We initialized the neuron biases in the remaining layers with the constant 0. We used an equal learning rate for all layers, which we adjusted manually throughout training. The heuristic which we followed was to divide the learning rate by 10 when the validation error rate stopped improving with the current learning rate. The learning rate was initialized at 0.01 and

reduced three times prior to termination. We trained the network for roughly 90 cycles through the training set of 1.2 million images, which took five to six days on two NVIDIA GTX 580 3GB GPUs.

### Discussion
Deep CNN achieves record-breaking results on hard dataset; slight performance drop with fewer layers highlights depth's importance.

Alright, I need to figure out whether a convolutional network architecture includes any noise layers. Noise layers are those that introduce randomness or noise into the network, like Dropout, Gaussian Noise, or Batch Normalization.

Looking at the context provided, it describes the architecture of a CNN with eight learned layers: five convolutional and three fully-connected. It mentions ReLU nonlinearity applied to every layer, response-normalization layers after the first and second convolutional layers, max-pooling layers following those normalization layers and the fifth convolutional layer.

Response-normalization is similar to Batch Normalization in that they both normalize the activations of a layer's outputs. But I need to see if any layers explicitly add noise or randomness. The context doesn't mention Dropout, Gaussian Noise, or other explicit noise-adding layers. It does talk about response normalization, which helps with generalization but isn't exactly introducing randomness in the same way as dropout.

So, based on this information, the network includes normalization and max-pooling layers for regularization but not traditional noise layers like Dropout or Gaussian Noise.
</think>

The context describes a convolutional network that uses ReLU nonlinearity, response-normalization, and max-pooling. While these techniques help with generalization, they do not explicitly add randomness or noise in the manner of dropout or gaussian noise. Therefore, the network does not include traditional noise layers.

### Discussion
## 7 Discussion

Our results show that a large, deep convolutional neural network is capable of achieving recordbreaking results on a highly challenging dataset using purely supervised learning. It is notable that our network's performance degrades if a single convolutional layer is removed. For example, removing any of the middle layers results in a loss of about 2% for the top-1 performance of the network. So the depth really is important for achieving our results.

### Introduction
[21]), but it has only recently become possible to collect labeled datasets with millions of images. The new larger datasets include LabelMe [23], which consists of hundreds of thousands of fully-segmented images, and ImageNet [6], which consists of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories. To learn about thousands of objects from millions of images, we need a model with a large learning capacity. However, the immense complexity of the object recognition task means that this problem cannot be specified even by a dataset as large as ImageNet, so our model should also have lots of prior knowledge to compensate for all the data we don't have. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) constitute one such class of models [16, 11, 13, 18, 15, 22, 26]. Their capacity can be controlled by varying their depth and breadth, and they also make strong and mostly correct assumptions about the nature of images (namely, stationarity of statistics and locality of pixel dependencies). Thus, compared to standard feedforward neural networks with similarly-sized layers, CNNs have much fewer connections and parameters and so they are easier to train, while their theoretically-best performance is likely to be only slightly worse. Despite the attractive qualities of CNNs, and despite the relative efficiency of their local architecture, they have still been prohibitively expensive to apply in large scale to high-resolution images. Luckily, current GPUs, paired with a highly-optimized implementation of 2D convolution, are powerful enough to facilitate the training of interestingly-large CNNs, and recent datasets such as ImageNet contain enough labeled examples to train such models without severe overfitting. The specific contributions of this paper are as follows: we trained one of the largest convolutional neural networks to date on the subsets of ImageNet used in the ILSVRC-2010 and ILSVRC-2012 competitions [2] and achieved by far the best results ever reported on these datasets. We wrote a highly-optimized GPU implementation of 2D convolution and all the other operations inherent in training convolutional neural networks, which we make available publicly .

### Training on Multiple GPUs
## 3.2 Training on Multiple GPUs

A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB of memory, which limits the maximum size of the networks that can be trained on it. It turns out that 1.2 million training examples are enough to train networks which are too big to fit on one GPU. Therefore we spread the net across two GPUs. Current GPUs are particularly well-suited to cross-GPU parallelization, as they are able to read from and write to one another's memory directly, without going through host machine memory. The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation. The resultant architecture is somewhat similar to that of the 'columnar' CNN employed by Cire¸ san et al.

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is crucial for reducing overfitting in image datasets by artificially increasing dataset size through label-preserving transformations, requiring minimal computation and storage. Two methods are employed: generating 224 × 224 patches with horizontal reflections from original images, expanding the training set significantly but introducing high interdependence among examples; and adjusting RGB channel intensities via PCA on ImageNet, adding multiples of principal components scaled by eigenvalues and random Gaussian variables to each pixel. At test time, predictions are averaged over ten patches (five positions plus their reflections) per image to enhance accuracy.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which loss functions were used in the convolutional network based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.

The context discusses a large deep convolutional neural network that achieved record-breaking results using supervised learning. They mention the importance of depth and describe training techniques like data augmentation and multi-GPU training. However, when I look for loss functions specifically, there's no direct mention of any particular ones like Categorical Cross Entropy or others listed in the examples.

The discussion sections talk about model performance, dataset size, and training optimizations but don't specify which loss function was employed. The introduction explains why CNNs are suitable but again doesn't detail the loss functions used. Similarly, the sections on multi-GPU training and data augmentation focus on how they parallelize computations and reduce overfitting without mentioning loss functions.

Since none of these sections provide information about the specific loss functions used in their architecture, I can't extract any names from the context. Therefore, it seems like there's no available data to answer the query with the required details.

We wrote a highly-optimized GPU implementation of 2D convolution and all the other operations inherent in training convolutional neural networks, which we make available publicly .

### Data Augmentation
## 4.1 Data Augmentation

The easiest and most common method to reduce overfitting on image data is to artificially enlarge the dataset using label-preserving transformations (e.g., [25, 4, 5]). We employ two distinct forms of data augmentation, both of which allow transformed images to be produced from the original images with very little computation, so the transformed images do not need to be stored on disk. In our implementation, the transformed images are generated in Python code on the CPU while the GPU is training on the previous batch of images. So these data augmentation schemes are, in effect, computationally free. The first form of data augmentation consists of generating image translations and horizontal reflections. We do this by extracting random 224 × 224 patches (and their horizontal reflections) from the 256 × 256 images and training our network on these extracted patches . This increases the size of our 4 training set by a factor of 2048, though the resulting training examples are, of course, highly interdependent. Without this scheme, our network suffers from substantial overfitting, which would have forced us to use much smaller networks. At test time, the network makes a prediction by extracting five 224 × 224 patches (the four corner patches and the center patch) as well as their horizontal reflections (hence ten patches in all), and averaging the predictions made by the network's softmax layer on the ten patches. The second form of data augmentation consists of altering the intensities of the RGB channels in training images. Specifically, we perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the ImageNet training set. To each training image, we add multiples of the found principal components,

with magnitudes proportional to the corresponding eigenvalues times a random variable drawn from a Gaussian with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. Therefore to each RGB image pixel I xy = [ I R xy , I G xy , I B T xy ] we add the following quantity:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where p i and λ i are i th eigenvector and eigenvalue of the 3 × 3 covariance matrix of RGB pixel values, respectively, and α i is the aforementioned random variable. Each α i is drawn only once for all the pixels of a particular training image until that image is used for training again, at which point it is re-drawn.

### Discussion
In our experiments, we avoided unsupervised pre-training despite its potential benefits due to computational constraints. Network size and training duration have improved results but are still far from matching human visual system capabilities. Our goal is to use large, deep convolutional nets on video for better temporal information extraction compared to static images.
